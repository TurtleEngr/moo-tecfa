<h2>Description of Tutorial</h2>

  <!--What are the goals of the presentation? (100 words) -->

"WOO" stands for both "WEB Object Oriented" and "W3 + MOO". MOOs are a
variant of text-based virtual realities also known as MUDS (Multi-User
Dimensions or Dungeons). WOOs or Webbed MOOs combine the flexibility
of the MOOs with the WWW's ability to deliver structured text,
multi-media and interactive forms over the Internet. A webbed MOO thus
acts as a flexible HTTPD server. The purpose of this tutorial is to
introduce Webbed MOO Technology to a wider audience at both the
conceptual and technical level.

We will address in particular the following topics:

<UL>
<LI>Collaborative Work with Webbed MOOs 

<LI>Adaptive Information Systems 

<LI>Webbed MOOs in Education and Training 

<LI>Interactive Collaborative Learning Environments 

<LI>Corporate and Commercial Issues 
</UL>

<h2>Length</h2>

  <!--How long is your presentation: a quarter day, a half day, or a full day?
      Would you consider other possibilities?-->
half day (other possibilities can be considered)

<h2>Tutorial notes</h2>

  <!--What additional information will you provide in the tutorial notes?-->

The tutorial notes will cover each talk in more detail and also point
to resources available over the Internet.

<h2>Book chapter</h2>

  <!--Do you plan to prepare a book chapter based on the tutorial?  If
  so, how will it differ from the tutorial outline above, if at
  all?-->

Yes we plan to prepare a chapter containing the materials used for the tutorial.
It will differ from the tutorial outline above in 2 ways: It will contain
more technical materials and it will be organized differently (to fit into
a book chapter).

<h2>Target audience</h2>

  <!--Who should attend?  What will they learn?  What background
  should they have?  (100 words) -->

There are several groups of people that may be interested in attending.

<UL>


<LI>Computer Supported Cooperative Work/Learning researchers

<LI>Educational Technologists and educators

<LI>Organisational Information Systems/Design Rationale researchers

<LI>People interested in MOOs

<LI>People interested in web access to Object oriented data stores

<LI>People interested in adaptive web access

</UL>

Attendees will learn about the scope of application for webbed MOOs
and will receive pointers to more information if they are interested
in investigating it further. Basic familiary on how a Web server operates
is required but no prior knowledge on webbed Moos.
