<H1>Webbed MOOs</H1>
<STRONG>Workshop proposal</STRONG>
for the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/Conferences/WWW4/">Fourth International World Wide Web Conference ``The WEB Revolution''</A>, December 11-14, 1995, Boston
<hr>
 <P>
Webbed MOOs developed from two technologies.  Firstly, MOOers were
trying to find ways to make the MOOing experience more
three-dimensional by adding other media alongside the usual text.
Secondly, people working with the WWW needed more adaptive and
flexible ways of representing the information they wanted to publish.
With the bringing together of the two technologies, the goal of
adaptive, structured hypermedia was partly achieved.
 <P>
The goal of this workshop is to discuss the emerging technology of
webbed moos and where it should go from here.  It will examine the
present state of the technology and ask how it can be improved to
make the most of extensions to clients and the introduction of new
data types such as VRML.  It will look at ways to improve the existing
structure of webbed MOOs and how to construct some standard guidelines
for the webbing of MOOs.  In addition, the setting up of structures
for formal discussion of webbed MOOs will be discussed.

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Participation</STRONG>:
<DD>Prospective participants for the workshop are asked to submit a short position
paper outlining their interest in webbed MOO technology and their
present knowledge of it.  This will help to guide the discussion onto
areas of interest for all participants.  Those wishing to attend should
have at least some knowledge of MOOing and what it involves, with
preferably some experience on the running of webbed MOOs.  An outline
of some of the topics to be covered are given below.
Participants are required to submit a paper in html format (preferable
a link to some server of their choice) 2 weeks before the workshop,
so that the workshop itself can concentrate on discussion, and not presentation.
