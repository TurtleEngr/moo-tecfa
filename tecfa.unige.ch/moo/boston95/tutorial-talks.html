<LI><STRONG>Introduction: MOOs and webbed MOOs</STRONG>
<br>Speaker: Daniel K. <a href="woo-tutorial2.html#Schneider">Schneider</a>.
 <P>

A MOO is a network-accessible, multi-user, programmable, interactive
system.  Participants usually connect to a MOO with specialized
telnet-based "client" program. Having connected to a character,
players then give one-line commands that are parsed and interpreted by
the MOO server as appropriate. Such commands may cause changes in the
virtual reality, such as the location of a character, or may simply
report on the current state of that reality, such as the appearance of
some object. MOOs allow for individual users to extend the environment
both programmatically, and by "building" or creating new objects. In
an educational context, this can allow the student to become an active
participant in the learning experience. In a professional context,
users can build virtual offices, meeting spaces and other artifacts.
 <P>
Webbed MOOs are an extension to MOOing but can also be considered as
flexible user adaptive object oriented http servers. Both the concept
of a MOO and of a webbed MOO will be shortly introduced in this talk.

<LI><STRONG>Collaborative Teleworking for Distributed and Multinational Organizations</STRONG>
<br>Speakers: Jenifer <a href="woo-tutorial2.html#Tennison">Tennison</a> and Samuel <a href="woo-tutorial2.html#Epstein">Latt Epstein</a>.
 <P>
The need for information to be shared within an organization has grown
due to the expansion of companies over continents.  Workers no longer
exist in the same office, but need to communicate with other workers
who are spatially some distance from them.  In addition, larger
projects are being undertaken that need time to complete, and with
a high staff turnover rate, this means that those who start a project
are not necessarily those who complete it.  What is needed is a
flexible and dynamic means to satisfy the collaboration requirements
of these organizations.
 <P>
Several systems have been developed to meet these needs.  Organizational
Information systems such as TOSCA (Prinz, 1993) allow information
about those working within the organization to be available for others
in a easily-navigable hypertext format.  Several Design Rationale
systems have been developed which structure the design process by
explicating the argumentation structures behind discussions on how
artifacts should be designed.  Again, these structures are often
represented in a hypertext form for ease of navigation.
 <P>
This talk will outline the contribution of webbed MOOs to the internal
needs of organizations, describing how they can archive information,
facilitate communication and present this information in a hypertextual
format.
 <P>

<LI><STRONG>New Century Marketing - Focusing Your Message For The Global Marketplace</STRONG>
<br>Speakers: Samuel <a href="woo-tutorial2.html#Epstein">Latt Epstein</a> and Jenifer <a href="woo-tutorial2.html#Tennison">Tennison</a>.
 <P>
It is hip to present your organization over the web, offering information
on the services and goods for sale in a colorful, imaginative way.
However, where these presentations fall down is in their lack of
adaptivity and interactivity.  Different customers require different
services from organizations, and have varied knowledge about them.  In
order to catch custom, they must be presented with the product they
need in the shortest length of time.  Webbed MOOs are flexible enough
to deal with adapting to customers from a variety of backgrounds, and
can be given the intelligence needed to present appropriate information.
In addition, webbed MOOs can glean information from the customer,
aiding in the conducting of market surveys and increasing the feeling
of proximity between the customer and organization.
 <P>

<LI><STRONG>Adaptive flexible Hypertext and CSCW Systems</STRONG>
<br>Speaker: Gavin <a href="woo-tutorial2.html#Bell">Bell</a>.
 <P>
Users have difficulties retrieving information from electronic
information systems.  However they must know roughly what they are
looking for, otherwise how do they know when they have finished.  The
act of navigation defines a search for information, from this it
should be possible to create a model of the desired information. The
MOO server can be used to implement flexible information systems,
including hypertext.  This can be used to allow the user personalised
views of an information space.  It can also act as a CSCW (computer
supported collaborative work) tool, for information sharing
 <P>
This talk will focus first on the creation of adaptive models of the
user's current information interests. This model is formed by
capturing the user's path of navigation. The system can then
adaptively present other nodes within the information system which
related to the navigated path of the user.  Finally it concludes with
an overview of some of the areas into which the system may
develop. These include knowledge representation, visualisation
techniques and distributed servers.

<LI><STRONG>Virtual Worlds for Education and Research</STRONG>
<br>Speaker: Daniel K. <a href="woo-tutorial2.html#Schneider">Schneider</a>.
 <P>

MUDs have been in educational use for a number of years now. This talk
will present first a short overview on MUDs used for research and
education and discuss various "uses" of text-based VR technologies for
learning, teaching and support of research work. The potential of
webbed MOOs will be discussed in particular by taking examples from
existing WOOs but also by addressing their increasingly strong CSCW
and CSCL potential.
 <P>

<LI><STRONG>WOOs in corporate training</STRONG>
<br>Speaker: Marcus <a href="woo-tutorial2.html#Speh">Speh</a>.
 <P>
WOOs are responding to a growing need of training departments in
multinational organizations for better reuse of human and curricular
resources. WOOs stand for a wider class of virtual reality learning
environments. In this talk, we will try to argue that 'Webbed MOOs'
can make a significant difference in a growing market of vendor
products. Our argument will be based not on technology, but on the
appropriate application/training context and the content provided for
teaching on Webbed MOOs. In particular, we propose the following
benefits to commercial organizations with the need for corporate
training:
<UL>
<LI>Overcoming of geographical dispersion
<li>Store information centrally, disseminate globally
<li>Ease international collaboration and knowledge integration
<li>Lower training costs globally while increasing performance
<li>Foster innovative teaching and learning techniques
<li>Exploit a growing interest in technology and social worlds which
have successfully been explored on the 'Information Superhighway'
for years.
</UL>
This talk is not primarily targetting the technologically literate. 
Examples will be provided through Andersen Consulting's
WOO-based world-wide virtual campus, as well as a currently growing
group of users with developing commercial applications of WOOs.
 <P>

<LI><STRONG>A primer on WOO Technology</STRONG>
<br>Speaker: Jenifer <a href="woo-tutorial2.html#Tennison">Tennison</a>.
 <P>
This section will focus on the technology behind WOO.  Firstly, it
will detail the philosophy behind the development of WOO technology,
which is that advances using the World Wide Web should be made by
increasing the intelligence of the servers rather than producing a number
of extended clients.  We will describe how information can be stored
in an object oriented manner for access via the web and how this
access can be made flexible, adaptable and secure.  Finally, the
three generations of WOO will be outlined: MOOs accessed through
cgi-bin scripts from a standard httpd server; MOOs accessed directly
and MOOs accessed through a perl script, and give examples of each.

 <P>
<LI><STRONG>Example applications</STRONG>
<br>Speaker: Samuel <a href="woo-tutorial2.html#Epstein">Latt Epstein</a>.
 <P>
This section is example based and we will address topics like:
<UL>
<LI>ease of construction & interpretation of forms

<LI>use of knowledge about users as separate entities

<LI>multimedia information served by the MOO server

<LI>dynamic documents

<LI>direct, real-time communication between people via a web browser

</UL>

Three good example applications that will be discussed are:
<OL>
<LI>the sports scores served on sprawl.

<LI>programming using the web with version control.

<LI>virtual conferences using the web as electronic whiteboard.
</OL>
We will point out how easy these applications are to construct
within a webbed MOO.
