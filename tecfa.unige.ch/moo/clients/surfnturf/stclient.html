<h2>Welcome</h2>
Thank you for your interest in the 'Surf_and_Turf' Web-MOO client.  This Java 
based client was designed
by the <a href="http://www.bvu.edu/ctown">CollegeTown</a> MOO development team at
<a href="http://www.bvu.edu"> Buena Vista University</a>
 to make it easy for MOO users to view and display Web
Pages from inside their virtual communities.  MOO administrators who wish to make this 
client available to their users may consult the
<a href="stclient.html#instructions"> INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS</a> below.
Using the S&T client you can create MOO objects and attach Web Page addresses to
them.  You can then 'view object' to bring up the page on your own browser
 screen or 
'display object' to bring up the associated Web Page on the browser screens of 
everyone else in the room. The purpose of this client is to make collaborative 
web viewing as simple as possible. Additional moo coded objects such as
<a href="http://www.bvu.edu/ctown/help.html"> web
slide projectors</a> are available on <a href="http://galaxy.bvu.edu">
CollegeTown</a> for porting if you wish.<br>
<b>Want to Try it out?</b> Press <a href="http://www.bvu.edu/ctown/WebMOO.html">here</a> to activate the client and pay a visit to CollegeTown, Buena Vista
University's virtual community.<br>
 (<b>Caveat:</b> The S&T Client
 works best when accessed through Netscape under Windows 95. It  will not
 work as well on Macs until Netscape has fully implemented Mac Java
 socket connectivity.)

<h2>Using the S&T Client</h2>
Using the S&T Client to create a MOO object with an associated Web Page is
extremely simple.<br>

Suppose you have a picture of your new puppy on a web page somewhere and you want 
to look at that picture from inside the MOO. Just type:
<pre>
    @create $thing named ZeldaPicture
    connect ZeldaPicture to http://www.bvu.edu/faculty/schweller/zelda.jpg
</pre>
Then
<pre>
    view ZeldaPicture
</pre>
and Bingo! Zelda's cute little picture pops right up on the web part of the
screen. If you want to show Zelda's picture to everyone in the room just
type:
<pre>
    drop ZeldaPicture
    display ZeldaPicture
</pre>
and everyone in the room using this client will see the little pup! <br>
You can make MOO objects and link them to all sorts of things.  Here are some ideas:
<ul>
  <li>  MobyDick      - linked to text of Melville's great work
  <li>  BVU_homepage  - linked to Buena Vista University's Home Page
  <li> AltaVista     - linked to that great web search engine
  <li> Syllabus      - linked to your online reading list</pre>
</ul>


<h2>Additional Help</h2>
The T&S Client also includes additional features to make the  online editing of notes, verbs,
and ascii drawings much simpler.
This is accomplished by making the MOO screen itself 'editable' so you can,
for example, read your note, edit its contents right on the screen, and then 
resave the edited text.
