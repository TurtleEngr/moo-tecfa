Welcome to the 'Surf_and_Turf' Web-MOO client. This Java based client allows you to easily attach viewable Web Pages to any MOO object.  You may then *view* your objects privately or *display* them to everyone else in the room. The purpose of this client is to make collaborative web viewing as simple as possible. For full instructions on the use of the 'Surf_and_Turf' Client <a href="http://www.bvu.edu/ctown/help.html">press here</a>.
<hr>
The most interesting feature of this client is that you can show URLs to
persons using the same client being in the same room, example:
<pre>
    @create $thing named truc
    connect truc to http://tecfa.unige.ch/tecfamoo.html
    view truc
    display truc
</pre>
