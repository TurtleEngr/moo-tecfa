<h3><a name="objects">To Create and View Web Objects</a></h3>

<pre>
Suppose you have a picture of your new puppy on a web page somewhere and you want 
to look at that picture from inside the MOO. Just type:
    @create $thing named ZeldaPicture
    connect ZeldaPicture to http://www.bvu.edu/faculty/schweller/zelda.jpg
Then
    view ZeldaPicture
and Bingo! Zelda's cute little picture pops right up on the web part of the
screen. If you want to show Zelda's picture to everyone in the room just
type:
    drop ZeldaPicture
    display ZeldaPicture
and everyone in the room using this client will see the little pup! 
You can make MOO objects and link them to all sorts of things.  Here are some ideas:
    MobyDick      - linked to text of Melville's great work
    BVU_homepage  - linked to Buena Vista University's Home Page
    AltaVista     - linked to that great web search engine
    Syllabus      - linked to your online reading list</pre>
<h3><a name="projector">To Build a Web Projector</a></h3>
<pre>
Another fun thing to do is to create a Web Projector to hold a whole set of web slides
 for viewing or display.  To do this type:
    @create $webprojector named MyWebProjector
Then use @notedit MyWebProjector.slides to create your slide set like this:
        @notedit MyWebProjector.slides 
        enter
        http://www.bvu.edu
        http://www.gamelan.com
          etc.
        .
        save
        q
To show slides to everyone in the room type:
    display 4 on MyWebProjector   or
    display next on MyWebProjector
To view a slide by yourself 'view 3 on MyWebProjector'
To peek at your slide list at any time type 'peek MyWebProjector'. </pre>
<h3><a name="display">To Lock your Web Display</a></h3>

<pre>    
If you wish to lock the Web Screen so other pages are not loaded in on top of it just
select the 'Lock Window' button from the 'Options' menu on the Client screen. If you 
would like the Web Screen to display the rooms you enter as you move about select 
'Auto Room View' from the 'Options' menu, or simply use the MOO command:
    @client on/off</pre>

<h3><a name="notes">To Edit Notes</a></h3>
<pre>
Any text you see on the MOO Screen above the Command Line can be edited. 
For example, if you had a $note called ShoppingList you could type:
   read ShoppingList
and you might see
    loaf of bread
    jug of wine
    Thou
To add 'Gummy bears' to the list just move your cursor into the MOO Screen and 
edit as you normally would. The Edit_MOO_Screen menu gives you access to the 
customary CUT, COPY, and PASTE commands.  When you are done editing select the section 
you wish to save. Go back to the command line and type:
    @notedit ShoppingList        (to edit the contents)
    del 1-$                      (to delete current contents)
    enter                        (to get ready for new stuff)
Then click on 'Paste to Command Line' from the edit menu. Move your cursor back to
the Command Line and press Return. Type a single period and Return to terminate the
'enter' session. Finally, type 'save' and 'q' and your editing is complete.</pre>
<h3><a name="maps">To create ASCII Room Maps</a></h3>
<pre>
To add a new ASCII map describing your room walk about in the MOO and find a
room that is roughly about the size and shape you are looking for. Move your cursor
to the MOO Screen and modify that picture to suit your tastes.  Then return to 
your own room that you wish to describe.  Just as before, type:
     @notedit here.description
     del 1-$
     enter
Then 'Paste to Command Line' and finish your editing session as before.</pre>
<h3><a name="verbs">To Edit Verbs</a></h3>
<pre>
This general technique can be used any time you wish to do any sort of text
editing of a moo object. It is also very useful for debugging code.
     @display toy:play without numbers
Then edit the code in the MOO Screen, select and copy it. Then type:
     @program toy:play
Click on 'Paste to Command Line', hit return in the command line, and type a single 
period to complete the entry.</pre>

<h3><a name="paste">To @Paste to Other Users</a></h3>
<pre>
If you have the @paste feature on your character you can simply use your mouse to 
select a portion of the MOO Screen (or write your own message there to be selected) 
and then Copy it. Type:
     @Paste
and then use the 'Paste to Command Line' command as before and end your pasting 
by typing a single period on a line by itself.</pre>
