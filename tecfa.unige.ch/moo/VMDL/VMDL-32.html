From the outside, David knocks politely and wonders if it may @join?

&gt;page david yes sure
Your message has been sent.

You sense that David is looking for you in The Tecfa Atrium.
It pages, &quot;where is the conference room?&quot;

&gt;@exam here
Conference Room (#1302) is owned by Sandrine (#166).
Aliases:  Conference Room and conf
There's a blackboard on the front wall and a clock above it. Type @status to 
get the state of the room. Do not forget to use 'speakup &lt;anything&gt;', or stand
to be heard throughout the room. To use the blackboard, type 'writeb 
&lt;anything&gt;', and to erase, type 'cleanb'. If you need help, just type 'help 
here'. 

&gt;page david @go #1302
Your message has been sent.

David teleports in.

David says, &quot;hi. I'm still getting used to this stuff :-)&quot;

&gt;&quot;hi david
You say, &quot;hi david&quot;

David says, &quot;I remembered reading all this nifty social commands like knocking and something that was supposed to take you to where someone else was, but couldn't figure it out when I needed it :)&quot;

&gt;&quot;it comes with some time
You say, &quot;it comes with some time&quot;

David says, &quot;Anyway, I'm trying to get up to speed on the moo, and hoping you could help maybe.&quot;

&gt;&quot;yes, what's your question
You say, &quot;yes, what's your question&quot;

David says, &quot;I watched the TV from the Mooseum, and am wondering what to look at next, aside from the programmer's manual.&quot;

&gt;&quot;Well, there are lots of objects you can watch
You say, &quot;Well, there are lots of objects you can watch&quot;

David says, &quot;I still don't understand events or different types of rooms very well. Also, I need to try out robots some more, particulrly talking ones.&quot;

&gt;&quot;the best robots are the ones that bring back conversation, naughty ones
You say, &quot;the best robots are the ones that bring back conversation, naughty ones&quot;

David says, &quot;;)&quot;

&gt;&quot;I made one that can talk and bring back conversation
You say, &quot;I made one that can talk and bring back conversation&quot;

David says, &quot;hmm, I thought I was supposed to wink that?&quot;

David says, &quot;maybe my emotions have left somehow?&quot;

&gt;&quot;don't say that, it's too hard for me to ear this
You say, &quot;don't say that, it's too hard for me to ear this&quot;

David says, &quot;I still need to know what things can do so as best to set up a mystery. Of course I still need to think up the mystery itself :)&quot;

&gt;&quot;well you can use objects that move by themselves
You say, &quot;well you can use objects that move by themselves&quot;

&gt;&quot;let me think
You say, &quot;let me think&quot;

&gt;&quot;something like Mr X appear round the corner and goes est
You say, &quot;something like Mr X appear round the corner and goes est&quot;

&gt;&quot;sorry appears and goes east
You say, &quot;sorry appears and goes east&quot;

David says, &quot;I think that might be a bit more complex than we want for the first try.&quot;

&gt;&quot;so what do you want for the first try
You say, &quot;so what do you want for the first try&quot;

David says, &quot;I think we coulod do with just objects that stay still but need to be examined and or questioned for people to find out enough information to solve the mystery.&quot;

&gt;&quot;so that's fine, you need genering thing object and conversational robot
You say, &quot;so that's fine, you need genering thing object and conversational robot&quot;

David says, &quot;My 0th attempt was to just write the whole thing in one note in a room.&quot;

David says, &quot;But we want more rooms and things, and perhaps some tricky robots, that don't say everything they know right off, or maybe even lie!&quot;

David says, &quot;I also wonder whether events might be useful?&quot;

&gt;&quot;what do you really mean by events?
You say, &quot;what do you really mean by events?&quot;

David says, &quot;well, I saw something about event-triggered rooms, though I don't really understand it. I guess the built-in ones are exiting and entering rooms.&quot;

&gt;&quot;yes colin has done some things like that
You say, &quot;yes colin has done some things like that&quot;

David says, &quot;but I think, also, some other events can be defined, such as picking something up maybe, or looking at it?&quot;

David says, &quot;but maybe that could wait until &quot;phase two&quot; :)&quot;

&gt;&quot;yes that's fine, you can do this easily
You say, &quot;yes that's fine, you can do this easily&quot;

David says, &quot;so do you have a conversational robot I could play with?&quot;

&gt;&quot;it can ease the process for users to get feedback
You say, &quot;it can ease the process for users to get feedback&quot;

&gt;&quot;best thing is to create your own
You say, &quot;best thing is to create your own&quot;

&gt;&quot;I show you how
You say, &quot;I show you how&quot;

David says, &quot;yes, that's something I hadn't thought much about, Pierre had this idea of a truth machine,...&quot;

&gt;&quot;what kind of truth machine you mean some tool that detect if the robot says the truth
You say, &quot;what kind of truth machine you mean some tool that detect if the robot says the truth&quot;

&gt;&quot;it seams complicated
You say, &quot;it seams complicated&quot;

David says, &quot;I guess so, or the players can enter their suspicions and find out if the solution is correct.&quot;

&gt;&quot;ok
You say, &quot;ok&quot;

&gt;&quot;actually, you can use verbs attached to conversational robots or similar ones and attach them to a generic thing
You say, &quot;actually, you can use verbs attached to conversational robots or similar ones and attach them to a generic thing&quot;

David says, &quot;attach the verbs from robots to generic things?&quot;

&gt;&quot;well not attach but copy
You say, &quot;well not attach but copy&quot;

David says, &quot;why is that better than just having the robots?&quot;

&gt;&quot;because you can adapt your verbs better
You say, &quot;because you can adapt your verbs better&quot;

&gt;&quot;or you can adapt the robot's verb and call the robot truth machine
You say, &quot;or you can adapt the robot's verb and call the robot truth machine&quot;

David says, &quot;&quot;okay. To start off with, is there an easy to use robot that has some interesting things to say, that I could play with?&quot;

David yawns widely.

&gt;&quot;let's begin by examining the robot
You say, &quot;let's begin by examining the robot&quot;

David says, &quot;sorry about that yawn, I'm still wondering why these other social things don't work the way I remember them.&quot;
 
David says, &quot;I have one like that I think, that can monitor.&quot;
David teleports out.

You sense that David is looking for you in Sandrine's office.
It pages, &quot;I'm in your office. I don't know how that happened&quot;

David has arrived.

David says, &quot;Hmm, very strange. I think I accidently activated a hangglider, whatever that is.&quot;

David says, &quot;I'm not sure how I got back either, through several rooms.&quot;

&gt;@move #1427 to here

Sandrine hushes kalia.

David smiles happily.

&gt;-david this one is both, you can monitor her and its a robot

David checks kalia's vocabulary.

&gt;&quot;no it responds to here, I have to change that

&gt;-david you can teach one word at a time to a robot, no more
You say to David, &quot;you can teach one word at a time to a robot, no more&quot;

David says, &quot;what does it mean by responds to here? That means whenever anybody says anything with the word &quot;here in it?&quot;

&gt;&quot;yes
You say, &quot;yes&quot;

David says, &quot;what if you say soemthing with two of the robot's words?&quot;

&gt;&quot;that's why it is interesting to adapt the verb

&gt;&quot;hello, here
You say, &quot;hello, here&quot;

kalia says, &quot;[to Sandrine] hi, what a surprise, happy to see you &quot;

David says, &quot;so if we adapt the verb, we could look at multiple words, or even parsing?&quot;

David says, &quot;hello&quot;
kalia says, &quot;[to David] hi, what a surprise, happy to see you &quot;
David says, &quot;hello bye&quot;&quot;
kalia says, &quot;[to David] hi, what a surprise, happy to see you &quot;

David says, &quot;I guess it's the first word,...&quot;

&gt;&quot;yes if you adapt it could work better
You say, &quot;yes if you adapt it could work better&quot;

David smiles happily.
David grins.
David says, &quot;that's better, I look like an idiot smiling so much :)&quot;
David says, &quot;I like the sphynx part.&quot;

David says, &quot;wait kalia is a fancy puppet not a conversational robot. Is she adapted with those verbs?&quot;

&gt;&quot;yes kalia is both because I add the verbs of the conversational robot to those of the fancy puppet
You say, &quot;yes kalia is both because I add the verbs of the conversational robot to those of the fancy puppet&quot;

kalia says, &quot;[to David] Welcome here. Nice of you to visit our center. It has been built for communities or researchers working on educational technology matters. It is part of the VMDL project (Virtual Mobility and Distributed Laboratories).&quot;

David says, &quot;I'm looking at the code for &quot;tell on kalia. It looks like it should be simple to make a more sophisticaed parser.&quot;
  (kalia) David says, &quot;I'm looking at the code for &quot;tell on kalia. It looks like it should be simple to make a more sophisticaed parser.&quot;

David says, &quot;that is if I can undwerstand these utilities properly :)&quot;
  (kalia) David says, &quot;that is if I can undwerstand these utilities properly :)&quot;

&gt;ignore kalia
  (kalia) Sandrine stops monitoring.

&gt;&quot;yes I guess so
You say, &quot;yes I guess so&quot;
David says, &quot;that sounds sort of up my ally as computational linguist :)&quot;

&gt;&quot;exept that there is a tell verb for every player and it's a dangerous thing to change
You say, &quot;exept that there is a tell verb for every player and it's a dangerous thing to change&quot;

David says, &quot;I'm not sure I understand that - wouldn't I just be changing for a subclass?&quot;

&gt;&quot;well I am not sure either but I add trouble when I changed that one
You say, &quot;well I am not sure either but I add trouble when I changed that one&quot;

&gt;&quot;I could not speak anymore
You say, &quot;I could not speak anymore&quot;

David says, &quot;I also wonder, is it possibel to &quot;hide&quot; the keys of a robot, so you can't tell what will trigger them, or what the range of things is that they could say?&quot;

&gt;&quot;yes verbs have attribute, they can be visible or not
You say, &quot;yes verbs have attribute, they can be visible or not&quot;

David says, &quot;so if we made the keys invisible on kalia, we couldn't inspect what she could say?&quot;

&gt;&quot;in this case only the owner can watch but beware of the role of the player
You say, &quot;in this case only the owner can watch but beware of the role of the player&quot;

&gt;&quot;guest can't do much, easy
You say, &quot;guest can't do much, easy&quot;

&gt;&quot;player can't see sereval thing, they can not programm
You say, &quot;player can't see sereval thing, they can not programm&quot;

David says, &quot;that might be the solution -force people to be guests.&quot;

&gt;&quot;player should be enough
You say, &quot;player should be enough&quot;

&gt;&quot;guest is annoying 
You say, &quot;guest is annoying &quot;

&gt;&quot;you can't teleport
You say, &quot;you can't teleport&quot;

David says, &quot;yeah, I was guest for a while and couldn't do much.&quot;

&gt;&quot;and you cannot join anybody
You say, &quot;and you cannot join anybody&quot;

&gt;&quot;problem is for administrators and wizards
You say, &quot;problem is for administrators and wizards&quot;

David says, &quot;Daniel created my charecter when I first got here, but there was a bug, so I didn't really get a password. Problem was it prevented me from getting a new one until we figured this out and he fixed it.&quot;

&gt;&quot;you can do nothing against them they're naughty
You say, &quot;you can do nothing against them they're naughty&quot;

David says, &quot;what are the types of people?&quot;

David says, &quot;there's guest and player and builder and programer and wizard?&quot;

David says, &quot;is that right?&quot;

&gt;&quot;guest, player, programmers, administrators, wizard and that's all
You say, &quot;guest, player, programmers, administrators, wizard and that's all&quot;

&gt;&quot;player can build
You say, &quot;player can build&quot;

&gt;&quot;you know the wizard?
You say, &quot;you know the wizard?&quot;

David says, &quot;to be in the experiment. If so, then we could put artificial limits, create new characters, with one-shot passwords, etc.&quot;

&gt;&quot;it might be difficult to evaluate the effect of the moo with only non-moo people
You say, &quot;it might be difficult to evaluate the effect of the moo with only non-moo people&quot;

David says, &quot;if we want moo people to also be in the thing,m then I have to try to be careful so that they don't see things beforehand.&quot;

&gt;&quot;ok, best thing is to take moo player 
You say, &quot;ok, best thing is to take moo player &quot;

&gt;&quot;and no programmers
You say, &quot;and no programmers&quot;

David says, &quot;right. It's taken me a while to get up to speed. I also watched the tv you made from the task force, and saw how much troubloe they had,...&quot;

&gt;&quot;at least, these people must have training on the moo 
You say, &quot;at least, these people must have training on the moo &quot;

&gt;&quot;about communication, navigation and habbits
You say, &quot;about communication, navigation and habbits&quot;

David says, &quot;I'm not quite clear on what programmers can do that players can't. is it only write programs, or are there other operations, that they can't do, like snooping?&quot;

&gt;&quot;well, don't really know, they can watch program of others as well
You say, &quot;well, don't really know, they can watch program of others as well&quot;

David says, &quot;right, I was thinking we'd have to give some training on all of (1) moo (2) drawing tools (3) the task itself. though hopefully some of this could be done together. &quot;

&gt;&quot;you know, people can be programmer but you can ask them to enter the moo with just a player status for your experiment
You say, &quot;you know, people can be programmer but you can ask them to enter the moo with just a player status for your experiment&quot;

David says, &quot;controlling for moo experience might also be tough - presumably some people will know better how to get around, whoch might screw up the results.&quot;

David says, &quot;If they are programmers, could they program things in an environment that didn't belong to them?&quot;

&gt;&quot;not easy to set up, better to distinguish between roles
You say, &quot;not easy to set up, better to distinguish between roles&quot;

&gt;&quot;what do you mean by an environment that did not belong to them
You say, &quot;what do you mean by an environment that did not belong to them&quot;

&gt;&quot;you can program objects anywhere
You say, &quot;you can program objects anywhere&quot;

&gt;&quot;and drop them anywhere exept in locked rooms
You say, &quot;and drop them anywhere exept in locked rooms&quot;

&gt;&quot;but people can not enter in locked room either exept the owner
You say, &quot;but people can not enter in locked room either exept the owner&quot;

David says, &quot;well, I meant that they couldn't reprogram a robot or room that didn't belong to them.&quot;

&gt;&quot;no they can look at verbs code but it readable only for them
You say, &quot;no they can look at verbs code but it readable only for them&quot;

David says, &quot;right, I geuss all the rooms would have to be locked, with keys held only by the players.&quot;

&gt;&quot;yes, what you could do is use 'zone'
You say, &quot;yes, what you could do is use 'zone'&quot;

&gt;&quot;it's a group of room that belong to the same project
You say, &quot;it's a group of room that belong to the same project&quot;

David says, &quot;I read about these domains in the mooseum.&quot;
David says, &quot;I should have used them to create the stuff I already did if I knew about them.&quot;
David says, &quot;so If I made a zone, I could put the same lock and keys on all the rooms at the creation level?&quot;

&gt;&quot;I don't really know if you can do that, we have to see
You say, &quot;I don't really know if you can do that, we have to see&quot;

&gt;&quot;you can also use channels for your experimentation
You say, &quot;you can also use channels for your experimentation&quot;

David says, &quot;what are channels?&quot;

&gt;&quot;channels of communication
You say, &quot;channels of communication&quot;

&gt;&quot;each player connected to the same channel receive the same information
You say, &quot;each player connected to the same channel receive the same information&quot;

&gt;&quot;anywhere in the moo
You say, &quot;anywhere in the moo&quot;

David says, &quot;hmm, that sounds nice, though actually, it might be good for our players to be able to go to different places and then have to communicates their findings to each other.&quot;

David says, &quot;but these would be good, maybe for supervisory information.&quot;
David says, &quot;l&quot;
David says, &quot;oops&quot;

&gt;&quot;yes or for clues
You say, &quot;yes or for clues&quot;

David says, &quot;yes, though I was thinking the clues could come to the individuals who would maybe have to share them with each other.&quot;
