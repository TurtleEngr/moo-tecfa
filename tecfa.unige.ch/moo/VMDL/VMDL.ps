% FrameMaker users specify the proper paper size for each print job in the
% "Print" dialog's "Printer Paper Size" "Width" and "Height~ fields.  If the
% printer that the PS file is sent to does not support the requested paper
% size, or if there is no paper tray of the proper size currently installed, 
% then the job will not be printed.  The following flag, if set to true, will
% cause the job to print on the default paper in such cases.
/FMAllowPaperSizeMismatch            false def
%
% Frame products normally print colors as their true color on a color printer
% or as shades of gray, based on luminance, on a black-and white printer. The
% following flag, if set to true, forces all non-white colors to print as pure
% black. This has no effect on bitmap images.
/FMPrintAllColorsAsBlack             false def
%
% Frame products can either set their own line screens or use a printer's 
% default settings. Three flags below control this separately for no 
% separations, spot separations and process separations. If a flag
% is true, then the default printer settings will not be changed. If it is
% false, Frame products will use their own settings from a table based on
% the printer's resolution.

/FMUseDefaultProcessSeparationScreen false def
%
% For any given PostScript printer resolution, Frame products have two sets of 
% screen angles and frequencies for printing process separations, which are 
% recomended by Adobe. The following variable chooses the higher frequencies
% when set to true or the lower frequencies when set to false. This is only
% effective if the appropriate FMUseDefault...SeparationScreen flag is false.
/FMUseHighFrequencyScreens true def
%
% The following is a set of predefined optimal frequencies and angles for various
% common dpi settings. This is taken from "Advances in Color Separation Using
% PostScript Software Technology," from Adobe Systems (3/13/89 P.N. LPS 0043)
% and corrolated with information which is in various PPD (4.0) files.
%
% The "dpiranges" figure is the minimum dots per inch device resolution which
% can support this setting. The "low" and "high" values are controlled by the
% setting of the FMUseHighFrequencyScreens flag above. The "TDot" flags control
% the use of the "Yellow Triple Dot" feature whereby the frequency id divided by
% three, but the dot function is "trippled" giving a block of 3x3 dots per cell.
%
% PatFreq is a compromise pattern frequency for ps Level 2 printers which is close
% to the ideal WYSIWYG pattern frequency of 9 repetitions/inch but does not beat
% (too badly) against the screen frequencies of any separations for that DPI.
