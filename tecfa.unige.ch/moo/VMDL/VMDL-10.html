<H3>2-1.3   Organisation of virtual meetings</H3>
We invited the European Science Foundation's - Learning in Human and Machine - task force 5 (collaborative learning) group to have a meeting which goal was to prepare the work for a four month away workshop. <P>
This community was chosen for the following reasons:  <P>
<UL>
<LI>regular use of computer and especially of computer mediated communications,  <P>
<LI>internet access (most of people are working from European Universities),  <P>
<LI>organisational need for a forthcoming face to face workshop,  <P>
<LI>small number of researchers (ten or so),  <P>
<LI>mature community (several face to face meetings before the moo session),  <P>
<LI>the person in charge of the task force 5 works in TECFA.<P>
</UL>
We have thus decided to choose such a community to limit the problems related to technology, newborn relationships within a community, lack of concrete need and too distant or indirect organisation. Indeed other factors than the proposed environment could have influenced how people reacted about this new communication facility. <P>
The meeting date was then decided through traditional e-mail interactions and the problems people had to discuss on the MOO were reminded within this exchange. <P>

<H4> Consolidation by informal meeting </H4>
As a MOO server is a permanent database, we encouraged researchers from the LHM community to create some habits on TECFAMOO. Indeed, we helped those interested in to build their own office and the kind of interaction that took place is illustrated in this report's part. What we aimed to do was actually to encourage people to log on the TECFAMOO on a regular basis for the community to try different contexts of interactions (planned meetings but also informal discussions, use of mail facilities, etc.)<P>
