Pierre says &quot;I don'see Karen...&quot;
Kim Issroff says &quot;sorry she is in the arrival hall not the reception&quot;
Sandrine says &quot;she is disconnected it seems&quot;
Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk says &quot;Hej Kim, How are you? How is your work progressing? &quot;
Daniel says to Kim Issroff [Guest], &quot;no she is not, she is BEFORE login, so I can't see here, tell her to type 'connect guest' or something like that&quot;
Pierre asks &quot;Yes, she is not there. Kim, could ask her to try again?&quot;
Kim Issroff says &quot;she thinks that she is connected &quot;
Kim Issroff says &quot;she has just had permission denied to enter the bus&quot;
Pierre says &quot;shre probably was not very polite with the bus driver&quot;
Kim Issroff says &quot;She is laughing but insists that they won't let her on&quot;
Kim Issroff says &quot;Daniel she is using the www interface&quot;
Sandrine says &quot;she should propably try again, she can be disconnected and still view the moo interface&quot;
Kim Issroff says &quot;Thanks Sandrine - she is trying again&quot;
Daniel says to Kim Issroff [Guest], &quot;ok with that it is hard to talk and VERY hard to use artifacts (most of that stuff does not work yet, tell her to use another client, e.g. telnet or the tinyfugue connection (password = calvin99)&quot;
Sandrine says &quot;she's there&quot;
Kim Issroff says &quot;but she says that she has disconnected but is coming back&quot;
Pierre asks &quot;Did karen log in as Ken Schweller?&quot;
Sandrine says &quot;yes&quot;
Daniel says to Kim Issroff [Guest], &quot;no she REALLY should not use the www interface alone ... you need another client side by side&quot;
Daniel says to Pierre, &quot;no ken schweller is somebody else ... actually a mythical figure in the moo world&quot;
Kim Issroff says &quot;she is trying again - she said she logged in as a guest&quot;
Kim Issroff says &quot;what does this mythical figure do&quot;
Daniel says to Kim Issroff [Guest], &quot;like he programmed a lot of artifacts ... e.g. the camera we are using here ... and he is a &quot;wizard&quot; on a few famous MOOs&quot;
couqui teleports in.
Daniel says to Kim Issroff [Guest], &quot;no she is still using the www interface only ... that never will work&quot;
Pierre asks &quot;what does she have to do then ?&quot;
Daniel says &quot;I am giving Kim some instructions ... but right now the www interface is rather for looking at things or for sending short messages, that is all, however if you have both www and another client the 2 will work together for registered users&quot;
joze is now a programmer.
Kim Issroff asks &quot;she is now trying on telnet which hasn't worked and is just clicking on the Tinyfugeu connection - what is a tinyfugue connection?&quot;
Daniel says to Kim Issroff [Guest], &quot;tinyfugue is a unix MOO client, I set it up so that people can use it remotely from anywhere in the world&quot;
Daniel says &quot;this is a message from the www interface, but it only works with netscape 1.1&quot;
Kim Issroff asks &quot;she now is back on the very first page of tecfamoo stuff again - will you help her now?&quot;
Daniel says to Kim Issroff [Guest], &quot;tell her to type 'connect guest'&quot;
Kim Issroff says &quot;cancel that last one - we are not communicating very well - she has just found the tinygugue connection again and is launching telnet&quot;
Daniel frowns &quot;as long as she is outside I am stuck, sorry :(&quot;
Kim Issroff says &quot;I know - she says that Telnet is being launched several times now&quot;
Daniel says to Kim Issroff [Guest], &quot;so again: the username is 'tiny' (the www tells you that) and the password is 'calvin99'&quot;
joze asks &quot;Daniel, some  people here would like to know how many participats can use MOO at a time?&quot;
Kim Issroff says &quot;she is just typing the password. What does the camera do? &quot;
Daniel says to joze, &quot;depends on the machine you got, I would say on this one about 200&quot;
Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk asks &quot;Hi Kim, Are you in the reception Hall?&quot;
Pierre says &quot;OK, while Daniel is fixing Karen's problems, I would like to start talking about ESF&quot;
Sandrine asks &quot;the camera is recording, do you want to stop it?&quot;
Pierre says &quot;Remember we ahd very ambitious - and probably sincere - plans in SItges&quot;
joze exclaims &quot;Bob says: Pierre, hurray!!&quot;
Kim Issroff says &quot;I don't mind at all but my computer seems to record everything and I can scroll back through it so I was wondering what more the camer does&quot;
Pierre says &quot;But now, I guess not much has been done, we have only 3 months lefts and these are holidays (at least a part of it) and conferences&quot;
Kim Issroff says &quot;Daniel - Karen's computer has now crashed so she is starting again&quot;
Daniel says to Kim Issroff [Guest], &quot;you are right of course, but with a camera you can do more, like putting up the sessions on display in a &quot;TV&quot; here&quot;
Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk asks &quot;Hej, What do you do with the camera?&quot;
Daniel zooms the camera in on Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk. . .
Daniel says to Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk [Guest], &quot;filming you ;)&quot;
joze asks &quot;How can Lone  and Annita act together?&quot;
Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk asks &quot;Hello, what do yoy do, Daniel?&quot;
Kim Issroff asks &quot;Daniel - Karen's computer now says Host not on host site: tecfamoo  ????????&quot;

Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk says &quot;Annita is a Ph.D.student from Oslo University. She has been in Aalborg since February. We are writing a paper together for the Aix-seminar.&quot;
Kim Issroff asks &quot;what is the paper about?&quot;
Pierre says &quot;I don't feel too guilty about the fact that we did not do much about ESF, since there is no real monney for research projects, but only for meetings. The original idea was to have a joint pilot project per task force.&quot;&quot;
Pierre asks &quot;yes, what is thios paper about ?&quot;
Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk says &quot;the title of the paper is: Problemorientation as a method, and as a fundamenet for computer mediated collaborative distance learning. &quot;
Pierre asks &quot;what is 'problem orientation'?&quot;
Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk says &quot;we are using a method called Soft Dialectics which is based on dialectical analysis and Soft System methodology (Checkland)&quot;
Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk says &quot;Problem orientation is work method and a fundamental principle for critical pedagogy.&quot;
Pierre does not understand
joze says &quot;Bob says: I wish that I could see the bubbles coming out of Patrick's head&quot;
joze asks &quot;Bob says: what are you really thinking about?&quot;
joze says &quot;BOB says: but Patrick is still daydreaming!! what can I do to bring him into this virtual world&quot;
Daniel pokes Patrick!  Patrick makes a sound that resembles that of the Pillsbury doughboy.
Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk says &quot;Our work again: We are using Soft Dialectics to structure our discussion on collaborative learning at distance here at Aalborg University. &quot;
Daniel says to Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk [Guest], &quot;anything of that on a www server by any chance ?&quot;
Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk says &quot;Yes, of course we can...when it is finished&quot;
Daniel says to Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk [Guest], &quot;it is useful to have it there before, so people could comment, unless it is secret or really in its VERY beginning stage&quot;
joze asks &quot;Bob says: ok, to be serious.  I expect that only Pierre can create a practical framework into which folk in TF5 can do something useful before Aix.  Does anyone have any ideas about what this practical thing might be?&quot;
Daniel says to Kim Issroff [Guest], &quot;hey that is strange ... telnet is one of the most basic internet services ! ... can she connect to any other machine she knows ?&quot;
Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk says &quot;If you are interested: we will be happy to mail you information about Soft Dialectics and abour problem oriented project&quot;
Pierre asks &quot;Ok, I thnik the best strategy we can have for Aix is that we try to discuss things that we do anyway, and preferably which is connected to the goals that were allocated to the three subgroups. Let's for instance talk about the subgroup 3 since it included Lone, Bob, Joze who are here (and Stevan who is not). Its goal was to review tools for supporting collaborative learning. Would Lone's paper fit to that goal?&quot;

Pierre asks &quot;Did Joze and Bob plan to do something about that goal during Joze's visit in Lancaster?&quot;

Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk says &quot;Yes, because we are reviewing and exploring the use of the conferencing system FirstClass. This anlysis is a fundament for design of tools and pedagogical strategies.&quot;

Sandrine says &quot;karen is here for true&quot;
A warning light flashes on video:  &lt;&lt; Tape Full &gt;&gt;
A warning light flashes on Sony:  &lt;&lt; Tape Full &gt;&gt;

joze says &quot;Bob says: would it be a start to identify the functionalities that we need of tools first.  Each of us is a member of this group (and probably others).  Hence, we should be able to compile a list of things we want to do 'at a distance'.  One dimension which influences this will be the 'nature of the collaborative task'.  This is an area in which McGrath and Hollingshead claim that little work has been done.&quot;

Pierre asks &quot;Sandrine, could you change the tape ?&quot;

Sandrine says &quot;yes sure&quot;
A warning light flashes on video:  &lt;&lt; Tape Full &gt;&gt;
A warning light flashes on Sony:  &lt;&lt; Tape Full &gt;&gt;
Sandrine teleports tape out.
A warning light flashes on video:  &lt;&lt; Tape Full &gt;&gt;
A warning light flashes on Sony:  &lt;&lt; Tape Full &gt;&gt;

Daniel says to Kim Issroff [Guest], &quot;now she is here, but won't talk :)&quot;

Daniel picks up Sony.
 
Pierre asks &quot;Do you mean to identify the needed functionnalities at a theoretical level?&quot;

Sandrine turns on camera to begin recording. . .

Sandrine write protects tape.

-----SANDRINE GOES OUT AND TALKS ARE TRANSMITTED BY KALIA ----------
  (kalia) Pierre says &quot;Actually, despite the fact that I am in the subgroup 2, we had here to review various groupware, more precisely whiteboards (plus audio) that we need for the BOOTNAP project. We tested ShowMe, Belvedere, Kansas and are trying now LBL, Collage and Groupkit. We could make a synthesis about that...&quot;
 (kalia) joze says &quot;We are using LBL video, audio and wb tools in COST 14 project and we have some experiences with these and similar tools&quot;
 (kalia) Pierre asks &quot;How does it work?&quot;
&gt;lib
  (kalia) joze says &quot;Bob says:  I have no problem about looking at tools, but I would be worried if we didn't start with some real needs, contexts, and aims of the collaboration.&quot;

Obvious Exits: RH (to Reception Hall) and C (to Common room).
  (kalia) Sandrine leaves for the lib.
  (kalia) Pierre asks &quot;Learning isn't a goal?&quot;

  (kalia) joze says &quot; Our main problem represents limited througput of our international connection (from Slovenia). But we used the m localy and we foung them easy to use.&quot;

  (kalia) Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk says &quot;Hello again, during our analysis we have indetified some interesting phenomenon to be explored more deeply. Some of them are: Commitment is a critical aspect in various forms in Computer mediated collaborative learning (at distance). Articulation work (See Kjeld Schmidt and Liam Bannon) is another interesting phenomenon. There are som other aspects, e.g. what consitutes the virtual room and the interplay between the organisational elements and the design of the artefact (functionality and aestetics).&quot;
  (kalia) joze says &quot;Bob says: learning is a goal in intensional situations.  In our case as researchers, yes we are learning all the time but much of it is contextual and not necessarily directly intentional.&quot;
  (kalia) Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk exclaims &quot;To Pierre: For us, learning IS the goal!&quot;

  (billy) Colin teleports David Traum [Guest] out.
  (kalia) Colin teleports David Traum [Guest] in.
  (kalia) Pierre says &quot;David, the guy who just arrived, is precisely my colleague who spent much time trying these various whiteboards&quot;&quot;
  (kalia) Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk says &quot;Our interests are intentional learning. However, the principle s&quot;
  (kalia) Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk says &quot;ok, we contin. ...of problemorientation is to a large extent intereting in relation to work practice in general.&quot;
  (kalia) Pierre says &quot;By the way, the guy who wrote the 'yellow pages of CSCW', the most comprehensive survey of exisiting tools, is in Calle's lab. I metz Calle last week. He said he could ask him to prepare something as well&quot;
  (kalia) Karen says &quot;'am I talking to you?'&quot;
  (kalia) joze says &quot;Bob says: a key dimension here is motivation; one might link this closely to the nature of the problem.  Is this a real problem with which we can directly associate (say as part of our day-to-day work) or does it seem artificial - like an exercise.  Unlike Pierre, I hate jogging but given a real challenge to get up a hill (which motivates me) then I will make the effort (and enjoy it).&quot;

Your message has been sent.
  (kalia) Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk says &quot;According to group 3, I think it is important that this survey includes in-depth studies of exemplary use-situations (out of labs!)&quot;
  (kalia) joze says &quot;Bob says: I agree with Lone (et al) about naturalistic settings.&quot;
  (kalia) Pierre asks &quot;Do you remember this chapter that we wrote when preparing the ESF proposal. We described task features which impact on the effects of collaborative learning (e.g. the importance of regulation, the conceptual opnesss, etc.). COuld you use these criteria in your analysis Bob ?&quot;
  (kalia) joze says &quot;Bob says: thanks Pierre, I would need to revisit that document&quot;
  (kalia) Pierre asks &quot;OK, can we talk a bit about group 1. Karen and Kim are here. Do you have anythin related to the original goal (reviewing tools for analysing interactions) that could be presented? Did you interact with Mike and Claire about this&gt;?&quot;
  (kalia) Karen says &quot;'we thought that the goal of offering a complete paper was perhaps&quot;
  (kalia) Karen says &quot;'oops - hang on&quot;

joze has arrived.
  (kalia) Pierre says &quot;Karen, type you text continuously, without retrun, until the end of your message&quot;
joze asks &quot;Bob says: hey, Sandrine are you reading me?&quot;
&gt;&quot;yes bob, how are you?

You ask, &quot;yes bob, how are you?&quot;
  (kalia) Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk says &quot;We have to leave now. We have enjoyed to be MOO-ed, and hope to continue this discussion during the summer. Thanks to Pierre for intiating this meeting and organising it. So bye to all of you.&quot;
  (kalia) Karen says &quot;'we thought that we would produce an annotated bibliography of key analytic frameworks and kim and I are collaborating on analysising collaboration using three analytic tools - using categories of talk and time based analyses&quot;
joze asks &quot;Bob: great to find you.  Just an off-line remark.  I would be pleased to talk to you about VMDL when I come back to NL next week.  Maybe you could confirm with me your best email address?&quot;

You say, &quot;I still receive nectar messages&quot;
Patrick says &quot;He Bob what are you doing here&quot;
  (kalia) Kim Issroff says &quot;We have had some communication with Mike and Claire but it has been erratic&quot;
  (kalia) Pierre says &quot;Comparing three tools is interesting. It has not to be exhaustive&quot;
joze says &quot;Bob: just having a VMDL chat with Sandrine!!]&quot;
Patrick says &quot;You are in OUR lib&quot;
Patrick asks &quot;After if you want you can visit my office ?&quot;
  (kalia) Kim Issroff says &quot;part of what we want to show is that some tools are useful for some things and others for other things - seems obvious but neither of us have ever seen direct comparisons&quot;

  (kalia) The housekeeper arrives to remove Lone Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Annita Fjuk.
  (kalia) Kim Issroff says &quot;Karen comes out with some very profound statements&quot;
  (kalia) Karen says &quot;&quot;oops again!!!&quot;&quot;
  (kalia) Patrick goes out.
  (kalia) Colin leaves for the lib.


  (kalia) Pierre says &quot;All this sounds good. Now, it is about group 2 and I think I am the only member of it. I developped some ideas about how we could modify rulebase system to model the effect of interactions on problem solving. But these are still rather general ideas. I did not review models of collaboration, but some work on models of dialogue. But, my new colleague, David Traum, has developped a computational model of social grounding during his previous research. I was thinking about bringinh him with me in Aix...&quot;

  (kalia) Colin has arrived.
  (kalia) Pierre says &quot;Right, the other TF5 members who could not make this time asked me to set up another MOO session. I suggest to set up a second session at a fix time, by the end of this month, and then to choose some hour in the week at which yuo will now that you can find people in the LHM room.&quot;&quot;
  (kalia) joze asks &quot;Bob: can we make much more progress?  I wonder if Pierre could review the interactions and do a sythesis of Actions prior to Aix.  Or do you wish to meet again this way with (possibly) other actors?&quot;
  (kalia) Kim Issroff says &quot;I think another meeting is a good idea - and perhaps we could try to arrange smaller meetings in just our groups&quot;
  (kalia) Pierre says &quot;Ok. Here is my suggestion. For the next meeting, we'll meet in the LHM room but I'll ask Sandrine to create three rooms for each subgroup. I noticed that some of you left for the library when we were not discussing your own subgroup!.&quot;

  (kalia) couqui has disconnected.
  (kalia) Daniel says &quot;I think it would be a good idea for those who felt productive here to come more often... you can build your offices here (ask sandrine), also you can use this as non-intrusive tool for collaboration (e.g. I always have the MOO open and do 10 other things at the same time)&quot;


  (kalia) Pierre says &quot;So, we could stardt with a joint meeting in the LHM room and then go in the specific rooms.&quot;&quot;

  (kalia) couqui has connected.
  (kalia) Karen says &quot;'I think offices would be a useful idea.....it would certainly be an&quot;

  (kalia) Kim Issroff says &quot;I'd like to have it open all the time but I think that only works if you know several people who are likely to be around, but that comes with time. The reason I went to the library was that nothing seemed to be happening and I thought I'd use the time to look around&quot;

  (kalia) Pierre agrees with Karen

  (kalia) Sandrine says &quot;I will be please to guide you through this moo at any time&quot;
  (kalia) Daniel exclaims &quot;sorry I have to leave, see you sometimes and don't hesitate to contact us for more MOOing !!&quot;
Daniel exclaims &quot;sorry I have to leave, see you sometimes and don't hesitate to contact us for more MOOing !!&quot;

  (kalia) Sandrine smiles &quot;of the day :)&quot;
  (kalia) Karen says &quot;'could we each have an office? &quot;

  (kalia) Sandrine says &quot;yes&quot;
  (kalia) Daniel waves good-bye

  (kalia) Daniel goes home.
Daniel goes home.

  (kalia) Sandrine says &quot;this would be the best thing&quot;
  (kalia) Pierre says &quot;This is why I think that a second fixed meeting will help creating the community, creating the habit of looking at the MOO for taskfivers&quot;


  (kalia) Pierre asks &quot;Ok for private offices, but also meeting rooms for the 3 subgroups?&quot;

  (kalia) Kim Issroff says &quot;how about making it tuesday evening.&quot;

  (kalia) Pierre says &quot;as a new father, I prefer now to go home in the evening&quot;

  (kalia) Daniel teleports in.

  (kalia) Sandrine asks &quot;we may try to use the www interface the next time don't you think?&quot;

  (kalia) Patrick has disconnected.

  (kalia) Karen exclaims &quot;'I would appreciate it as my e-mail is very temperamental..but it would be a good way of making sure we get things done and get collaboration really moving offices and meeting rooms for sub groups would be good - so each group could arrange times to meet!&quot;

  (kalia) Kim Issroff says &quot;ok how about just specifying a lunchtime - a late one for you so that it is reasonable for us&quot;

  (kalia) joze asks &quot;What do I need to be able to use www interface?&quot;

  (kalia) Kim Issroff says &quot;I meant latish in that last message&quot;

  (kalia) Karen says &quot;'WWW is an excellent idea'&quot;

  (kalia) Karen says &quot;'lunchtimes are good - so do we need a restaurant to have working lunches in this MOO!!!!'&quot;

  (kalia) Sandrine smiles &quot;ok I have to leave as well, don't hesitate to come back before the next meeting :)&quot;
  (kalia) Pierre says &quot;Of course, we can not continue long with 'fixed' meetings. That would be non sense for a MOO. SO, I'll e-mail to all and ask for a new time slot. Actually, people did not complain about the time, they were simply not in today.&quot;

  (kalia) Sandrine smiles &quot;bye :)&quot;

  (kalia) couqui has disconnected.


  (kalia) Pierre asks &quot;I have to leave as well. Any question left?&quot;
