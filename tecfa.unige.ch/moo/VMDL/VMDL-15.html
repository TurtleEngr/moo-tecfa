<H4> The synchronous part:</H4>
The primary means of communication within a MOO is by talking to other people who are located in the same room as you are. An example transcript might look like:<P>
<PRE>

David says, &quot;hi. I'm still getting used to this stuff :-)&quot;
&gt;&quot;hi david
You say, &quot;hi david&quot;
David says, &quot;I remembered reading all this nifty social commands like knocking and something that was supposed to take you to where someone else was, but couldn't figure it out when I needed it :)&quot;
&gt;&quot;it comes with some time
You say, &quot;it comes with some time&quot;
David says, &quot;Anyway, I'm trying to get up to speed on the moo, and hoping you could help maybe.&quot;
&gt;&quot;yes, what's your question?
You say, &quot;yes, what's your question?&quot;

</PRE>
It is possible to talk privately to a person using a whisper command, or to talk to someone who is not in the same room by using a page command. Many other commands exist, and may be created as needed. An example is "CB" (Citizen Band) channels which can be used by all people working on one or serveral projects.<P>

<H4> The asynchronous part:</H4>
In addition to the synchronous component of MOO communication, there are e-mail and news facilities on this kind of server. Once a &quot;character&quot; is registered and even if he/she is not logged into the MOO, it is possible to send e-mail messages, and new messages are mentioned at the beginning of each MOO session. People can also subscribe to lists where messages meant to everybody or to specific groups are posted. &quot;Characters&quot; can even benefit of an answering machine that records intended synchronous messages when absent. Various kinds of manipulable "information objects" such as "books", "note-boards", "tutorial rooms", "poster" are an other flavor of asynchronous communication tools.<P>
