<H3>2-3.1   The TECFAMOO</H3>
The TECFAMOO is a text-based virtual reality. It is a Virtual Space for Educational Technology, Education, Research and Life at TECFA, School of Psychology and Education, University of Geneva, Switzerland. The TECFAMOO project has been started as a small informal project in the fall of 1994. Currently we have been using MOO technology as CMC tool for our own teaching and research. Since April 95, the TECFAMOO has an experimental World-Wide Web interface allowing to take increased benefits from both technologies. This latest development increases our commitment to MOO technology. TECFAMOO purposes are mainly: . <P>
