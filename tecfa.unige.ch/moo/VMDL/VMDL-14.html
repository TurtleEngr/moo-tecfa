Common room
You find yourself in the common room of the International Educational 
Technologies Center. This is a place where people from different communities
can meet and exchange ideas. So enrich yourself :)

In order to establish a connection with a MOO, people must have a &quot;character&quot; on the server. They must supply a password to login to the MOO as that character. Once the connection has been opened, all the commands that one type are perceived to come from one's character. When the connection is closed, the state of one's character (location, possessions, etc.) may be preserved by the server.<P>
The MOO server typically presents a virtual space organized into &quot;rooms&quot;. A room, in the MOO sense, corresponds to a place where characters or objects may be located. In the example above, we were in a room described as a the room of a specific building. If we typed " VMDL ", we would have been moved to a new room though an exit named " VMDL "<P>
