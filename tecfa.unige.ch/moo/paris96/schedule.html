      Note that other issues can be raised in plenary discussion

      Off Workshop: The "Eurogroup"

Please note that lunch is from 12:30 - 14:00 rather than 14:30 to allow
extra time for discussion in the afternoon.

We have three hour-long discussion sessions (A, B and C) where we will
split into three smaller groups to discuss separate issues.  We have tried
to assign people to these groups on the basis of preferences (either sent
to us by email or apparant interests expressed through position papers)
*and* to ensure each group has enough people with different perspecitives
to generate interesting discussion.

If you feel strongly that you want to change a group, you should try to
swap with someone in the group you want to change to.  If this proves
impossible, we will only consider reassignment if you prove to us you're
desperate ;)  Guests (Dick, Jay, Colin) will not be reassigned by us.
Group assignments are at the bottom of this email.

For those leading sessions (Doree, Jola, Araki, Rob, Chris, Jay), there
will be more information on what we expect from you soon (promise).

To reiterate, we will meet at the registration desk at *19:45* on Sunday,
and go to a restaurant which Gavin is sorting out for food, drink and
getting to know each other.

See you in Paris,

Jeni
