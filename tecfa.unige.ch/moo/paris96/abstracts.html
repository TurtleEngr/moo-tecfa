<LI>David Anderson, VEs and the WWW, <BR>
For the past twelve years or so my research has been in the general areas
of distributed and real-time systems, with a focus on developing middleware
and toollkits to enable applications with person-to-person communication.
<LI>Yoshiaki Araki, An internet based, large scale virtual environment, <BR>
Sony have been invetigating a large scale, shared virtual environment
suitable for use in the Internet.  The key focus of the project is the open
environment, suited to supporting large numbers of participants in a highly
interactive environment.
<LI>Jean-Francis Balaguer, Virtual Environment and WWW for Engineering, <BR>
In this paper we present how, by combining into a single tool the 3D input
and high-performance rendering capabilities of high-end VR systems with the
data-fetching capabilities of network browsers, we are able to handle the
distributed nature of the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) project and address
some of its information management issues.
<LI>Gavin Bell, Virtual environments from a hypermedia perspective, can
they become
personalised information spaces, <BR>
Hypermedia and virtual environments have a common goal, to share the nodes
and links through which different people move.  Thus we have common
information systems which are being used for multiple purposes. Creation of
personal views of this space will allow us to adapt the resource to fit new
uses.  This paper explores the possible synergy between these two
approaches and techniques for this adaption.
<LI>Kees van den Bergh, VEs and the WWW, <BR>
I'd like to present a set of commonly shared characteristics of shared
virtual environments.  These &quot;telepresence elements&quot; are believed
to be responsible for the telepresence experienced in the reviewed SVEs.
<LI>Seth Chaiklin, Educational Applications of VEs, <BR>
My primary interest in VEs is to explore their use in educational contexts,
especially at the university level.  I would like to use them as (a)
devices to supplement student/teacher interaction and collaboration beyond
the face-to-face classroom teaching, (b) devices to present materials that
could be used in educational contexts (e.g., museums), and (c) devices to
support distance learning or collaboration between remote sites.
<LI>Jeff Vander Clute,  VEs and the WWW, <BR>
As a content provider, we're not interested in simply having a web MOO.
We'd like to turn web pages into web spaces where users can interact while
viewing the same content.  In fact, we believe strongly that static content
is better in a book than on a monitor unless some value is added along the
lines of page annotation and real time chat.
<LI>Luc Girardin, Virtual Environments and the WWW, <BR>
For almost one year now, I have been doing research on the navigability in
cyberspace.  In this context, I have developed a framework to present
information about virtual locations to the World-Wide Web users in order to
overcome the lost-in-cyberspace syndrome.  This research, entitled
'cyberspace geography visualisation', has led to prototyping including an
integration a Webbed MOO (TecfaMOO).
<LI>Rob van der Haar, Virtual Environments and the WWW, <BR>
My main reason for participating in the workshop on Virtual Environments
and the World Wide Web is to share experiences, ideas, worries and visions
on Social Creative Virtual Environments with other people working in the
field.  I am especially interested in the role and effect of design issues
concerning these environments.
<LI>Chris Hand, Some User Interface Issues for Hypermedia Virtual
Environments, <BR>
This paper outlines some issues to be considered in the development of
hypermedia virtual environments, in particular user interfaces and
supporting architectures.  Taking webbed MOOs as a starting point, the
potential for using Java to increase interactivity is discussed, followed
by spatial issues, subjectivity and interoperability.
<LI>Anny Koh, VEs and the WWW, <BR>
It has proven very difficult to provide adequate and &quot;realistic&quot;
training in Requirements Engineering (RE).  Hence, our key interest in VEs
and the WWW comes from our motivation in exploring a
&quot;virtually-simulated&quot; training environment for RE.  This paper
aims to highlight out current considerations of VEs and the WWW for RE
training, and some issues on what a webbed-MOO might offer.
<LI>Daniel Schneider, Virtual Environments for Education, Research and
Life, <BR>
Virtual Environments for Education, Research and Life are interactive
cyberspaces where many users can communicate and collaborate in various
ways.  They also can build virtual like offices, books, blackboards,
artificial persons and more.  VEs should also provide optimal support for
information storage, retrieval and manipulation.
<LI>Doree Duncan Seligmann, WWW5 Virtual Environments, <BR>
My interest in virtual environments originates in work on 3D intelligent
systems [IBIS, COMET, KARMA] and multimedia systems [Rapport, MR, N-ICE].
My current research and testbed system [Archways] is directed at finding
new ways to make complex multimedia systems as transparent to use as the
telephone has become.
<LI>Kim Stephenson, Virtual Environments and the WWW, <BR>
An important next step in the web's evolution is the ability to do more
than just surf.  In other words, how can a group accomplish their tasks
utilizing the web as a medium?  This requires both asynchronous and
synchronous tools as well as a space to work in.  One way to organize all
the tools, information and resources is build a virtual environment to
house them.
<LI>Jenifer Tennison, Collaborative Information Environments, <BR>
This paper outlines my present work on webbed MOOs as a basis for adaptive,
collaborative information systems.  The combination of VEs with the WWW may
alleviate some of th enavigation problems experienced within hypermedia,
but offers problems of its own, both technically and due to its low
usability.
<LI>Jolanda Tromp, Criteria of Credibility: Creating the Illusion of Space
and Motion in Virtual Environments, <BR>
The World Wide Web is essentially a 2D space, which we are trying to turn
into actual 3D collaborative spaces for people.  In my work on navigation
and perception of virtual spaces I have come across a set of criteria for
credibility for the construction of spaces in textual and 2D media.
<LI>Nakhshon Tsouk, VEs as a Tool for Integrating Faculty and Students in a
Learning Community, <BR>
CMC is used as an extension of the common research model, which is
generally based on surveying existing knowledge, contemplating and
discussiong it with others, and then putting one's ideas into writing and
distributing them.  VEs can enhance usual CMC tools by integrating them
inside a new 3D metaphor, which replaces the widely used 'Desktop' 2D
metaphor.
