Hi I'm Kees van den Bergh. I work in the User Centred Engineering<br>
(UCE) group of the Service Development &amp; Support division of KPN<br>
Research, The Netherlands. KPN Research is the Research institute of<br>
the Royal PTT Netherlands NV.<br>
<p>
VEs are computer generated worlds through which the user can "walk".<br>
In a Shared Virtual Environment (SVE), several people can be present<br>
at the same time and they can communicate with each other.<br>
<p>
My interest is mainly in 3D-shared virtual environments. I'm not<br>
interested in technical issues about building SVEs, but in the<br>
communication aspect of these SVEs.<br>
By the communication aspect I 'd like to find out how the concept of<br>
telepresence can be used to substitute 'regular user interfaces'.<br>
<p>
I'd like to present a set of commonly shared characteristics of shared<br>
virtual enviroments. These "telepresence elements" are believed to be<br>
responsible for the telepresence experienced in the reviewed<br>
SVEs. Among these are:<br>
<p>
1)	A spatial lay-out of the environment<br>
2)	Freedom of movement<br>
3)	Responsiveness<br>
4)	Real world control<br>
<p>
Issue: "Can the concept of telepresence be used as an alternative<br>
approach to telecommunication systems for residential users, in such a<br>
way that the technological and emotional thresholds of domestic<br>
network access tools and services are lowered"<br>
<p>
An elaboration to the telepresence elements is added below.<br>
<p>
1.   Spatial lay-out of the environment<br>
<p>
Design the environment in such a way that the user can construct a<br>
mental map of it. Use magical 'transporters' only if they add extra<br>
functionality to the scene. This can be the case if large distances<br>
must be crossed to get somewhere.  Design the scenes in such a way<br>
that the user can discriminate between them.  When a user is in a<br>
room, the walls shouldn't be exactly the same on each side.  Doors,<br>
button and links can be made the same in each scene to help identify<br>
them.  Create depth in a scene by applying image textures (if the<br>
software allows it) or by object textures (grids of lines or small<br>
dots, for instance).  Objects that shift in front of each other<br>
(motion parallax) create an illusion of depth.<br>
<p>
2.   Freedom of movement<br>
<p>
When possible, use collision detection. When this function is not available,<br>
design the scenes in such a way that users don't have to manoeuvre through<br>
tight spaces. Keeping up speed (framerate) in the scene is critical. Allow<br>
people to explore the environment in all necessary dimensions. Adjust the<br>
travelling speed to the environment: slow when indoor and fast outside.<br>
Don't make buildings and rooms where nothing is inside, because people will<br>
want to enter everything they see and they will be disappointed when there's<br>
nothing to be seen.<br>
<p>
3.   Responsivess<br>
<p>
Provide feedback for every choice the user makes. Feedback can be auditory<br>
(clicking of a button) and visual (change of colour of the button). Advanced<br>
systems can even provide other feedback in the form of touch and force. The<br>
environment can respond in various ways to the user:<br>
<p>
 By greeting him when he approaches<br>
 -  By changing the sound of footsteps when the surface changes from stones to<br>
grass<br>
 -  By making a sound or changing the colour of the wall when a user bumps<br>
into something<br>
 -  By turning on lights when the user approaches<br>
 -  By automatically opening doors when the user approaches<br>
<p>
As a general rule, responding objects and interaction make the VE appealing,<br>
so make sure that the user can interact with (all) the objects in the scene.<br>
<p>
4.   Real world control<br>
<p>
Real world control on a high level can be achieved by mimicking everyday<br>
interaction. Examples are: opening doors, putting stuff in bags, driving a<br>
car. These clichs can be used in VEs based on standard metaphors. If the<br>
scene is abstract, clichs aren't available and real world control must be<br>
based on certain conventions about the way things work. Such conventions can<br>
be based on physics (when you squeeze something it becomes smaller) and on<br>
learning (turning a dial to the right results in a linear increase). The<br>
science of control ergonomics can provide some insight into these concepts.<br>
Indirect interaction via pop up menus might be replaced by more natural and<br>
direct equivalents in a VE.<br>
