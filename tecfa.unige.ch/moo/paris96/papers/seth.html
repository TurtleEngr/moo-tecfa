Educational Applications of VEs
A Position Paper

Interests in VEs
<p>
My primary interest in VEs is to explore their use in
educational contexts, especially at the university level.  I
would like to use them as (a) devices to supplement
student/teacher interaction and collaboration beyond the face-
to-face classroom teaching, (b) devices to present materials
that could be used in educational contexts (e.g., museums), and
(c) devices to support distance learning or collaboration
between remote sites.
<p>
A special interest in this context is the "spatial metaphor."
I work with a relational theory of knowledge, which fits well
with the spatial metaphor.  Thus, VEs can be seen as a way to
potentially and literally construct knowledge.	Conversations
and social interaction are important, but in an educational
context there is also an interest in capturing, recording,
formulating the results of these discussions.  To distill out
some conclusions.  VEs could be a useful device in that
process.
<p>
An intriguing feature of current VEs is that they are
programmable.	Unlike many other computer-based programs, the
scope of the actions are not so clear.  With wordprocessors,
spreadsheets, simulators, and composing programs one has an
impression of the basic functions and possibilities that are
available (even if one never learns to use half of them).  With
VEs, we have the possibility to create activities, principles,
and structures that cannot always be anticipated by the users.
Thus, it would be a mistake to view a VE as a more or less
delimited domain of action.
<p>
An important implication of the preceding point is that a VE is
defined primarily by its content, by the meaning of the world
and the activities that can be accomplished in it.  In other
words, the "spatial" metaphor alone is not a defining feature
of VEs, the concept of praxis is equally important.  VEs are
designed as dungeons, offices, natural worlds, museums, and so
forth.  It is not just "space" that is being used, but also our
knowledge of what practices are being carried out in those
spaces.
<p>
Continuing this line of thought, one can see that discussions
of design principles for VEs must also incorporate discussions
of the practices that one wants to support in these
environments.	In educational contexts, learning motivation
must be based on the content which one is working with.	A
critical feature of VEs is that they can be used to support and
focus work on the content that brings people together.  In an
educational context, the ideal would be that the VE is
transparent to the user.  That is, one does not want to use
much time and energy having the user both to learn and to use
the system.  If there are obstacles or difficulties, then they
should be intentionally built into the system.	Are there
special kinds of designs that would be especially useful in
educational contexts?
<p>
The best thing about standards is that there are so many of
them to choose from (attributed to Andy Tannenbaum).	The
workshop announcement uses "soft" words like guidelines and
recommendations, and even softer goals might be appropriate
such as "identifying fundamental questions" or "formulating
interesting topics for further exploration.
<p>
Suggestions for Discussion Items

<OL>
<LI>Conventions for objects
<OL>
<LI>Defining objects.  Main idea...are there some
				standard ways that users can expect to manipulate
				objects?  For example, I have experienced rooms
				where one must "look" to see a bulletin board,
				while one must "examine" a blackboard in the same
				room.  Unnatural.  Confusing.  Wouldn't it be good
				to have some conventions along these lines?	Also,
				conventions for abbreviations would be helpful.

<li>Manipulating objects.  I was shocked one day to
				discover that I could move someone's portable
				computer, and when I put it on a chair, it could no
				longer be "seen" when one came into the room.  If
				VEs are designed for asynchronous collaboration,
				then what conventions can or should there be so
				that persons do not come back to find that their
				objects have disappeared?

<li>Marking objects.	Would it be useful to mark
				generic objects so that their nature could be seen
				more quickly?	For example, objects that could be
				written on would be shown like this: *blackboard*,
				*wall*, *notebook*, *paper*.	Objects that could be
				moved:  +chair+

</OL>
<li>Representation/Experience of "spatiality".  The fact that
		VEs are based on a spatial metaphor is often mentioned
		when the special qualities of VEs are presented.
		Specific, explicit arguments for the value of this
		spatiality are not usually advanced, but they can be
		easily constructed from principles of human psychology
		(e.g., easier to remember, possibility to use prior
		knowledge about navigation and object manipulation).
		Important questions within this theme include:
<OL>
<LI>What are important or valuable features of the
				spatial metaphor that should be preserved in VEs?


<LI>How does one create feelings/effects of spatiality
				in interface design?  (e.g., I am impressed by how
				"unspatial" the WWW-MOO interface is).

<LI>What is the relation between "action" and
				experiences of spatiality?  That is, spatiality is
				not only visual, but created through action.  As
				one example, does the need to type commands to move
				create the feeling of effort in moving?

</OL>

<LI>Objects to support collaboration.
<OL>
<LI>Asynchronous communication.  Why should blackboards
				and bulletin boards in virtual reality behave as
				they do in classroom reality?  Should mail and
				message systems in computer systems be reproduced
				in VE systems?  Given the spatial metaphor and the
				concepts like threaded messages, perhaps there is a
				way of designing a "spatial" messaging system in
				which group discussions are "recorded" in these
				objects.

<li>Synchronous communication.  In group discussions
				ideas often get formulated with various symbols
				(e.g., short phrases that refer to complex ideas).
				Complex ideas get formulated in which several
				elements become related to each other.  Relations
				are inherently spatial.  Is it possible to create
				objects that represent or maintain ideas that arise
				in group discussion?  Is it possible to develop
				tools, conventions that make it easier to record,
				organize, structure the flow of natural
				conversation in a group discussion?

<li>Maintaining ideas.  Along the same lines, there
				have been ideas around to make "concept maps" in
				which students develop maps of conceptual
				relationships.  One version was constructed on a
				Macintosh that enabled (biology) students to
				develop a drawings of relationships between
				biological concepts.  The idea of being able to
				"move" through concepts is an intriguing idea.
				Instead of laying them out on paper, is it possible
				to develop tools for supporting collaborative
				construction of ideas.

Present knowledge/experience with webbed VE
<P>
My only experience with webbed VEs is limited to the
discussion/annotation forum for this workshop.	I also have
some limited experience with using MOO-based systems, and have
presented a 90-minute introduction of the main features of MOO
to a group of multimedia researchers.	I have about five years
experience in using telecommunications in educational and
informal projects.
