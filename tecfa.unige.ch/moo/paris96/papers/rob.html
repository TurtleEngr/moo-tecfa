<H1>Rob's Position Paper</H1>
<P><BR>

<H2>Interaction Design</H2>
<P>I would love to participate in the workshop Virtual Environments and the
World Wide Web on the 6th of May in Paris. My name is Rob van der Haar and
I'm a conceptual interaction designer (or interface philosopher :-) currently
working for Philips Research Laboratories in England. Last year I finished a
4 year course on Interaction Design at the faculty for Art, Media and
Technology of the <A HREF="http://www.hku.nl/">Utrecht School of Arts</A>
in the Netherlands. During the final year of the course I specialized in
Social Creative Virtual Environments related design.

<H2>New Topia</H2>
<P>As a business placement I was involved with the New Topia project of Philips
Research in the Netherlands. New Topia is a virtual environment based on a
standard telephone and a teletext television. In New Topia users are able to
navigate their character through a city where they can chat to other people
(using voice), play games together, find information and buy products. The
project has almost reached its phase of finalization and will soon be
introduced in the Netherlands, Belgium and probably in the UK as well. My role
was concept development and the design and implementation of services.

<H2>Digital City of Amsterdam</H2>
<P>At the beginning of 1995 I did a project for the
<A HREF="http://www.dds.nl/">Digital City of Amsterdam</A> during which I was
responsible for the redesign of their Web interface. The Digital City of
Amsterdam is a Free-Net like environment and uses a city metaphor. It was
initiated on the 15th of January 1994 by cultural centre 'De Balie' and hackers
organisation 'Hack-Tic'. At the moment there are approximately 30.000
registered
inhabitants and 4000 visitors a day. With the project we tried to make the
transition from a text interface to a dynamic graphical interface. We focused
on
concepts like identity, awareness, enhanced communication, spatial information
structuring and navigation.

<H2>Electronic Communities</H2>
<P>Since August last year, I have been working on the Electronic Communities
project of Philips Research based in Redhill. In cooperation with the Human
Behaviour Research Group I'm doing research on how communities emerge and how
this process can be facilitated using networked multimedia products. Focus
points of the project are representation and revelation of identity, awareness
and perception of other users, rich social interaction, expression of user
creativity, evolution of the environment and interaction with time. Currently
we are working on a prototype that makes some of the findings of our research
work tangible.

<H2>Why Paris?</H2>
<P>My main reason for participating in the workshop on Virtual Environments and
the World Wide Web is to share experiences, ideas, worries and visions on
Social
Creative Virtual Environments with other people working in the field. I am
especially interested in the role and effect of design issues concerning these
environments.

<H2>Food for Discussion</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Designers of Social Creative Virtual Environments should focus on providing
the users with tools, materials, space and mechanisms rather than offering them
fixed worlds with fixed rules.<P>
<LI>Within 10 years, a quarter of the worlds population will spend 50 percent
of their time in Virtual Environments. Within 25 years time people will be
paying loads of money to touch real sand and they will be shocked to meet a
real person. The end of the world, as we know it now, is near.<P>
<LI>Cooperation between different disciplines like e.g. media, politics,
technology, academic research, design and users is essential to make these
environments accessible, sensible, usable and enjoyable. Why don't they do
so?<P>
<LI>There are no such things as 'Virtual Societies' or 'Electronic
Communities'.
It is the community experience, whether physical or electronically mediated,
that counts.<P>
<LI>The majority of Virtual Reality research and development is focussing on
creating the ultimate reality experience? Reality is already out there so why
not go berserk in designing Cyberspace?<P>
<LI>And finally (this is a good one ;-) Textual virtual environments are a
thing of the past. It will be hypermedia today and 3D tomorrow!
