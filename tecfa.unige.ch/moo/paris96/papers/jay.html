           My name is Jay Williams and I'm hosting a BOF on "Business
Uses of VRML and 3D Interactivity on the Web", currently scheduled Wed.
evening, and although I don't have the outline complete yet (Maybe
tommorrow!) so it's not on the www.w3.org site, you can see the one we
used in December in Boston at 
<A HREF="http://www.serve.net/jmw/bof.html">http://www.serve.net/jmw/bof.html</A>.
We had
such good response (overflowed into the hall!) that I thought we'd do it
again.  Since you're hosting the most interesting workshop (shamless
flattery!) I wanted to make sure you knew about it and hopefully can
attend.
<P>
        I haven't had time to do a paper (or in fact a lot of
preparation for the conference) due to the demands of business, but I
would be very interested in attending your workshop if there is room.
I'm the director of R&D for serve.net, and some of our clients are
trying to do neat things in VE.  We work with Chicago, the Oakland
Raiders, and other entertainment oriented companies.
