BACKGROUND
<p>
For the past twelve years or so my research has been in the general areas of
distributed and real-time systems, with a focus on developing middleware and
toolkits to enable applications with person-to-person communication. Presently
I am a research scientist at Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs (MERL) in
Cambridge, Mass. During the two years I have been at MERL, I have been
developing Spline, a platform for multi-user interactive environments, and
Diamond Park, a social virtual reality application built on top of Spline.
<p>
Diamond Park is a social virtual environment in which multiple
geographically separated users can speak to each other and participate
in joint activities.  The central theme of the park is cycling.
Visitors to the park can explore a square mile of 3D terrain.  In
addition to the 3D animated avatars of human users, the park contains
a number of computer simulations including a tour bus.
<p>
Diamond Park is implemented using a software platform called Spline
(for Scalable PLatform for INteractive Environments) that provides
comprehensive support for the key features of the environments we
seek.  Spline provides a convenient architecture for implementing
multi-user interactive environments that is based on a shared world
model.  The world model is a distributed object-oriented database
containing information about everything in a virtual world---where
things are, what they look like, what sounds they are making, etc.
Applications interact with each other by making changes in the world
model and observing changes made by other applications.

DISCUSSION
<p>
As for issues and topics for discussion, I am interested in trying to develop a
list of standards that the group feels will be needed in order for large-scale
virtual environments to be widely deployed, and to assess how far along we are
as an industry in understanding what these standards should look like.
<p>
For example, Moving Worlds from SGI and others is about to be adopted as VRML
2.0. In terms of providing a shared space for multi-user interaction, VRML 2.0
provides for independent browsing of shared documents, but leaves open many
questions, such as how the distributed activities in a shared virtual
environment should be brought together -- i.e., what is the architectural basis
for sharing that brings together the effects of having many users in the shared
space, along with physical simulations, intelligent agents, etc? How can all
 the dynamic changes in the virtual environment be communicated in a scaleable
way to the participants? How can very large virtual spaces be composed from
smaller, independently designed and implemented worlds, and later fit together
(hopefully in a seamless way) to form a new whole? The VRAIS paper cited above
(available at http://www.merl.com/TR/TR95-16/Welcome.html) provides some ideas
about how to begin answering these questions.
<p>
I'm also interested in hearing about the applications that workshop
participants find most compelling, and in looking at what common needs they
have. What is most hindering progress in getting these applications built and
deployed -- is it technological limits such as high network latency, or lack of
good tools for developing content, or underdeveloped standards, or something
else?
