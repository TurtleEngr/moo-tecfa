1. Introduction
<P>
CERN is about to start building the LHC (Large Hadron Collider), 
which at its completion, in the year 2004, will be the world's 
largest machine for High Energy Physics. The LHC will require huge 
investments in effort and funding from all the CERN member states, 
and it is of capital importance that each single aspect of this 
huge project can be analyzed in every little detail, so that errors 
in the design of the premises and equipment can be determined as 
soon as possible. This will require the most efficient organization 
and technology at every stage of the design process.
<P>
In order to evaluate and promote the use of virtual environment
technology as a tool to help design, build and maintain the LHC 
premises and equipment, a pilot project was started in January 94 
by the Computer &amp; Network and the Accelerator Technologies divisions, 
under the name VENUS (Virtual Environment Navigation in the 
Underground Sites). In particular, VENUS  tries to provide tools 
and services for virtual prototyping and networked design integration. 
Both of these projects are based on the i3D system that combines into 
a single tool the 3D input and high-performance rendering capabilities 
of high-end VR systems with the data-fetchning capabilities of 
networked browsers. It allows the exploration of three-dimensional 
scenes described using VRML [3], where each 3D object can be annotated 
with a document of any kind of media documents that can be accessed on 
the World Wide Web [4].  Using a 3D device, the user can explore its 
three-dimensional data and request access to other documents. Three 
dimensional data is handled directly by i3D while the handling of 
other types of media is currently delegated to NCSA Mosaic or 
Netscape.
<P>
2. Virtual Prototyping for LHC
<P>
In any project of the scale of LHC, the design phase is probably the 
most delicate one, as this is when some critical choices are to be 
taken which could dramatically affect the final results, timing and 
costs. Unlike in commercial manufacturing, accelerator designers and 
engineers don't have a chance to improve their product on a "second 
generation". Each instrument is built once with very small 
possibilities of modifications. This implies that it must be perfect 
on the first and unique trial. 
<p>
The ability to visualize the model in depth is essential to a good 
understanding of the inter-relationships between the parts. 
Interactive navigation is a powerful method for reviewing, confronting 
and refining designs, that allows specialists to focus on items of 
interest, and simplifies identification of geometry in any section of 
the model. Colors assigned to engineering disciplines help examine 
design integration, look for gaps, part interferences and mismatches. 
Since the premises and equipment can be electronically preassembled, 
all fixing interferences can be visually checked, even clearances 
necessary for installations or moving parts and, all this accomplished 
well before the final design is released for construction. Since 
changes made in the later phase of production cost many times more 
than those caught in the prior phases, savings are inevitable.
<P>
Virtual prototyping allows managers and engineers to critique design 
as when watching physical mock-ups, but better and earlier. Virtual 
prototypes can be made available easily and immediately, at no extra 
cost, since each part has already a three-dimensional computer 
representation inside the CAD database. Since it can easily be kept in sync with the current design, virtual prototyping gives us much 
more of a responsive ability to study how the various parts and 
assemblies fit together; it helps reduce risks and costs, and 
shorten schedule.
<p>
3. Networked Design Integration<br>
<p>
The LHC-system will be designed, engineered and manufactured in a 
distributed manner by about three hundred institutions around the 
world. One of the challenges to be taken up, in order to guaranty the 
success of the LHC project, will be that of the technical information 
exchange for design and documentation purposes, between all the 
partners involved [2]. In particular, being able to access current 
or previous designs, in a seamless manner, is essential.
<P>
The World-Wide Web has added a universal organization to the data 
made available on the Internet allowing to view all hosts as a 
unique data source, and to treat all of this data as part of a 
single structured document. By composing the descriptions of each 
part or subsytem, and accessing them directly from the site where 
they are being designed, we are able to retrieve virtual prototypes 
reflecting the status of the latest or some previous version of the 
design. This behavior can be easily obtained by exploiting the 
inlining capabilities of both VRML and i3D's file format.
<P>
The browsing capabilities of the i3D system allows users to 
interactively recall and view information attached to 3D models, by 
selecting objects of interest during navigation. By allowing users to 
interactively recall and view the attached information by selecting 
objects of interest during navigation, the interactive 3D viewer 
becomes a natural front-end for querying information about 3D models. 
Annotations can refer to text, still images, technical drawings, 
sound, animations or even other 3D models, exploiting in this way all 
of the digital media capabilities of current workstations. Annotating 
each three-dimensional model with an HTML page provides us with the 
basic ability to structure the available technical information. Soon, 
we will be able to build such pages automatically when exporting the 
prototype from EUCLID. In the future, we plan to investigate the 
association of multiple URLs with each three-dimensional model and to 
provide context sensitive selection to determine which URL needs to 
be retrieved.
<p>
4. Conclusions and Future Work
<P>
In this paper, we have presented how, by combining into a single tool 
the 3D input and high-performance rendering capabilities of high-end 
VR systems with the data-fetching capabilities of network browsers, 
we are able to handle the distributed nature of the LHC project and 
address some of its information management issues. In particular, by 
accessing individual parts and subsystems directly from the site 
where they are being designed, we are able to reflect the distributed 
structure of the design process and make available virtual prototypes 
that are always in sync with the latest design. The browsing 
capabilities of the system allows us to attach documents of any<br>
 kind of media to each three-dimensional objects, offering a means 
to structure technical information and to present it under the most 
suited media.
<p>
Future work will concentrate on addressing the specific issues to 
the use of virtual environment technology in conjonction with the 
WWW for engineering purposes. In particular, we should consider the 
following directions of work:
<OL>
<LI>What are the functionalities that a browser have to offer in order 
to address the problems related to engineering? Do we need 
animation? Do we need geometric queries? Do we need specific 
visualization techniques?<br>
<li>What is the best way to retrieve information? Do we need context 
sensitive hyperlink retrieval? 
<li>What is the level of experience sharing that is required? Do we need 
multiple networked participants? Are settings for design meetings 
enough?
</OL>
