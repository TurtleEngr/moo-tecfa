<H1>Colin Campbell's</H1>

I am a member of the technical staff in Microsoft's advanced media group
responsible for the ActiveVRML technology initiative
(<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/intdev/avr">http://www.microsoft.com/intdev/avr</A>).
<P>
ActiveVRML is an innovative approach toward solving some of the
difficult problems associated with interactive media. These problems
include distribution, concurrency, synchrony and asynchrony,
compositionality, denotation, abstraction, and efficient implementation
strategies.
<P>
I will be prepared to demonstrate a reference implemenation of
ActiveVRML and show a method for creating and presenting composable
models of integrated interactive media. I can also discuss lessons
learned from ActiveVRML that apply to the problem of synchronizing media
in a multi-user, shared environment.
