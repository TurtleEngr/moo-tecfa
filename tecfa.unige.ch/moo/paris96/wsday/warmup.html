<H1>The warm-up discussion</H1>

In the beginning of the workshop we had a one hour discussion on
"what is a Virtual Environment". The purpose of this discussion was
to introduce participants and to produce a "brain-stormed" list of statements for
further use. This is what we came up with, i.e. has been written
on a flip chart. (So this is NOT a discussion transcript, but simply
a transcription of what was written on a few big sheets of paper
in chronological order and only slightly edited):

A VE is:
<OL>
<LI>Imaginary space
<LI>Real space
<LI>Virtual World vs. Virtual Construct.
<UL>
<LI> What does the "world metaphor mean" ?
</UL>
<LI>Simulate the "real" world"
<UL>
<LI>Transcend the real ?
</UL>
<LI>Concrete into Abstract
<LI>Unlimited Scope
</OL>
[Then people felt that we should rather discuss "What can we use a VE For?".
Here are in(out)puts:]
<OL>
<LI>Museums (Live yourself into history)
<LI>Learning
<UL>
<LI>Motivation from Immersion
</UL>
<LI>Communication
<LI>Collaboration
<LI>Immersion
<UL>
<LI>Tools for being there
</UL>
<LI>Learning by Doing
<UL>
<LI>Making mistakes
<LI>Role playing
</uL>
</OL>
[Of course discussion then went more general again:]
<OL>
<LI>Dynamic
<LI>Persistence
<LI>Groups
<LI>Adaptation by users not just by system
<LI>Creating our environment
<LI>Communication PLUS interaction
<LI>Communication + creation = collaboration
<LI>[Next somebody walked up to the flip chart and drew a graphic.
It had 2 axis: x=many-many/broadcast and y=sync/async. VE's were
are large circle somewhat in the middle....]

<LI>Usability
<LI>Presentation of VE: graphical vs. text
<LI>MOO as a Concept, [not a System to be discussed in detail here]
<LI>VEs are about PEOPLE
<UL>
<LI>Evolution through user participation
</UL>
<LI>Object orientation
<UL>
<LI>Sharing Objects across Moos ? Global Moos ?
</UL>

<LI>User Desires --> Interface --> Architecture [3 different levels]

<LI>Basic Action used differently by different people

<LI>Evolution

<LI>User Extensibility

<LI>Creation only necessary sometimes [what does that mean?]

<LI>The knowledge level [an allusion to Alan Newells distinction of knowledge
content and implementation]

<LI>Describe and Create
<UL>
<LI>Easier with Text than with graphics
</uL>

<LI>Tools for Personalization
<LI>User representation and avatars
<LI>VE is a space with an underlying goal
<LI>User evolve too
<UL>
<LI>Give access at text -> hypertext -> 3D graphics
</UL>

<LI>Multimodal Interaction
<UL>
<LI>Systems tend to be designed for one
<LI>Metaphors change across modes
</UL>

<LI>Different Cultures
<UL>
<LI>Virtual culture shock
</UL>

<LI>Underlying Goal
<LI>Evolution of VE (by users)
<LI>Evolution of Community
</OL>
