Three times 1 hour was devoted to group discussion. Results were

<STRONG>actions</STRONG> it supports - client decides how to represent the
actions
<UL>
<LI>How to describe ?

<LI>MIME ? (or something similar)

or moving objects into I/F ? JAVA? --> there are API issues
</UL>

<OL>
<LI>VE should at least be as good as real world (RW),
