<H3>1. Discussion Server <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="http://tecfa.unige.ch/ico/symbols/idea.gif" ALT="***"></H3>
A <STRONG>WWW-based discussion/annotation forum</STRONG> at
http://spsyc.nott.ac.uk:5555/"
has been used to
prepare the workshop and to organize activities after the workshop.
Original papers prepared by the participants are integrated into
its "Living Document System" [Note 9/97: this server has killed now].
<P>
This Forum is open for everybody interested in Virtual Environments.
