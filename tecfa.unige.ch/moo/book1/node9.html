One of the main advantages of the MOO stem actually from their reduced band-width, i.e. texts. A MOO connection is non-intrusive. One can still do
other work while interacting on the MOO. Since people have to type,
no transcripts are needed to store interactions (practically all MOO
clients do allow logging, and some MOO artifacts, e.g. ``VCRs'' can
tape conversations). Furthermore, text-based interactions allow somebody
to have several simultaneous conversation without overload after a few
hours of getting used to it. One can talk, whisper, page, show, radio,
mail, post and more all at the same time. Somebody mastering those
basic communication commands is very efficient in getting a lot of work
done at the same time. Now try that with 5 real people in your office,
3 telephone calls, 2 CUSEME sessions, a few open mail folders on your
screen and more ....
<P>
At a very general level we argue that for design reasons many-user
virtual worlds still should be based primarily on objects that
represent textual content.  Language will remain the primary vehicle
for communication and information despite all the recent multi-media
hype. Language has a capacitiy for organizing structured work and
interaction that other media don't have. More importantly it can be
argued that text-based virtual realities create a new form of
textuality (not written nor spoken) that has a few important features
useful for certain kinds of collaborative work (see
<A HREF="node43.html#secwrittenconverstations">7.1</A>) for more details on this important
issue.
<P>
One question to be answered honestly is of course: Do we really need
synchronous communication in order to be productive at work? In this case,
is is not more efficient to use email
for person to person communication, Usenet news or mailing-lists for
group communication and the Web for putting up information? Delayed
communication offers the advantage that people have time to think,
to structure before they send out messages. The answer [add details!!!]
is that synchronous communication is more efficient in many cases.
<P>
Of course, efficiency is not everything:
``people want to connect with people, not with letters or papers from people''.
This is one of reasons why people go to conferences after all.

<BLOCKQUOTE> `` &quot;It's not the shock of recognition,&quot; a Wired magazine reporter 
wrote after experiencing MUD, &quot;it's the shock of communication.  The 
organic sensation that you're connected to people evaporates from 
the printed page&quot; (Quittner, 93) but is alive on MUD.  This novel 
form of communication appeals to a basic desire to connect directly 
with others.  There is no other medium that allows so many people to 
interact remotely in a common 'space.'  But if merely interaction 
was the goal, why would people choose this mode of personal 
gathering over face-to-face encounters?  The answer lies in looking 
at how this new interaction is structured - its MEDIUM (the 
computer), FORM OF LANGUAGE, and CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK - to see why 
networking on MUDs forms a new type of community: one which allows 
people to negotiate a strong sense of self and individuality while 
participating in public space.''

Summing up, the MOO is a new medium that in some aspects outperforms
other modes of communication and in addition it is <I>the</I> new
market place.
