Roughly there are several levels
on which users can participate in various ways.
<P>
<OL><LI> The ``theme level'' or ``purpose level'' of
the MOO.<LI> The infrastructure level
<P>
  <UL><LI> The ``topology level'' defining what can be built and where<LI> The ``communications'' and ``transportation level'' defining
    how people can interact and move
</UL><LI> The social level: What manners are encouraged or/and allowed
</OL>
<P>
The most important question to start with when designing a MOO is maybe
not so much ``who should rule?'', but ``what should be ruled and how?''.
One aspect of ruling is therefore devoted to building rules that
participants should observe, an other is enforcing them and only
a third is about ``governing''.
<P>
MUDs are a sort of microcosm that can be related to larger societial
bodies such as ``states'' as well as to electronic artefacts such
as the Internet. Many questions asked there can be asked here.
Chip Morningstar (Lucasfilm Ltd.'s Habitat project manager) in a talk
on the electronic frontier related the creation of both the ``Net'' and
his habitat world to the creation of a nation:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> ``I hear a lot of the rhetoric 
associated with electronic media speaking in terms of &quot;creating a new 
world.&quot;  My experiences lead me to believe that this is a poor choice of 
metaphors.  Instead, I would prefer to speak of &quot;settling a new world.&quot;  
Although the electronic environment is, to be sure, the creation of 
people, it is not the creation of any single person or group.  While 
each part of it is designed and organized by somebody, the totality is 
not.  It is, in Hayek's words, &quot;the product of human action but not of 
human design.&quot;  The metaphor of creation implies a creator, which leads 
you to the constructivist view I described earlier.  The metaphor of 
settlement implies a diversity of actors, some individuals, some groups, 
some large organizations, each with its own aims and its own local 
knowledge.  As the settlements grow, their boundaries brush up against 
one another.  The various participants encounter each other and 
interact, and evolve conventions for getting along together peaceably.
<P>
Consider the settlement of North America by Europeans and the growth of 
our nation.  Nobody &quot;created&quot; or &quot;designed&quot; the United States of America 
in the sense that we now know it.  It was formed in a piecemeal fashion 
and evolved the complex structure we see today as it grew.  This growth 
did not, however, take place in a vacuum.  The various settlers drew on 
a variety of intellectual, legal and cultural traditions in the 
formation of their new nation.  This, of course, is the non-
constructivist model.  It is also, I believe, a better model for the 
actual way the Net has grown up until now.''

<P>
Morningstar's ``constructivist'' and ``non-constructivist''
<A NAME="tex2html62" HREF="footnode.html#485"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://tecfa.unige.ch/ico/navi/tex2html//foot_motif.gif"></A>
categories are interesting, but we relabel them in order to avoid confusion
with the well known psychological terms:
<P>
<OL><LI> The <EM>Constructionist</EM> view (Morningstar's ``constructivist'') claims that cyberspace worlds can be built according to new rules<LI> The <EM>``Grounded in Real Life View''</EM> (Morningstar's ``non-constructivist'') claims that such worlds are simple extensions of other organizations or more generally the body of social knowledge the participants bring along.
</OL>
<P>
While those fundamental stances can be debated in length, a few
related basic questions are important for this section, such as:
What should grow more or less unplanned in a MOO ?
What can and should be planned ? In what world do we let inital users ``let loose'' ?
On what tradition should we build ? Do we need to write down
a constitution like the nation states did in the last century ?.
More such questions can be asked and not all get the same answer
for all kinds of MOOs. However, one single practical theme can be 
abstracted for MOOs like the <B>TECFA</B><TT>MOO</TT> and that is:
<P>
<EM>A MOO needs a good ``constitution''</EM>:
<UL><LI> One that is clear about the theme and very basic (and acceptable) social rules<LI> One that is open for the future.<LI> One that allows people to extend their real work place in a organic
way.
</UL>
<P>
Some sort of stability and openness are not the only issues, a ``serious
MOO'' is not really a closed world, it's got be efficient as tool in
the same way other artefacts like ``real life'' conferences and workshops
<EM>including</EM> ``life around those events'' are.
