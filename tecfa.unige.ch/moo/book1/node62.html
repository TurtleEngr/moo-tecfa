               ***     A Guide to Manners   ***

Welcome to COLLEGETOWN.  As a member of this community or as
a guest we invite you to join with us in supporting the following
social interaction guidelines:

1. RESPECT OTHER PEOPLE. Citizens here are of all ages and 
     range from first grade students to college professors. 
     They come from many different parts of the world. Please 
     do not offend others with your language or actions. It 
     is polite to ask permission before visiting someone 
     else's home.
2. DON'T WALK OFF WITH OBJECTS THAT DON'T BELONG TO YOU.
     CollegeTown is based on trust. Put things back where you
     found them.
3. DON'T SPOOF. Don't make it appear that other persons are
     saying or doing something they aren't.
4. ONLY TELEPORT YOUR OWN THINGS.
5. DON'T SPY. 
6. DON'T SPAM. Don't annoy others by overloading the screen.
7. NO WEAPONS. This is an academic environment.
8. NO HARASSMENT.
