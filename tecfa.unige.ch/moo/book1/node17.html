When we sent out our students to look at MOOs in December 1994 after
a 2 hour MOO training session most students found that handling
of beginners and more so of first time users was insufficient.
Despite having pointed out ``Diversity University'' as the primary
educational MOO, our students were somewhat ``afraid'' of it. Since
then, a lot of improvement could be observed on this MOO (see: 
section <A HREF="node16.html#secWelcomeArea">3.2.2</A>).
<P>
Collegetown (among the MOOs studied) overally got the best marks,
also for its general ergonomics. Since some of out students were
psychology students EON's stage model (see section <A HREF="node36.html#secEONMOO">5.2.4</A>)
was found to be interesting. However, it was noted that EON needs
a lot of involvement and one student who tried to learn something
about Unix by looking at an ``aircraft carrier'' complained about
feeling really lost.
