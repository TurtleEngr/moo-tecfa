There are claims that in some aspects life on the MOO is better than
in the real world. Young makes a very general claim in this direction:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> ``So what KINDS OF EXCHANGES happen in this new medium?  Because 
of the both distanced and direct nature of MUD interaction, players 
are more socially confident than in face-to-face situations:  MORE 
INPUT IS OFFERED, input IS MORE FREELY OPINIONATED, and there is 
LESS PRESSURE FOR PARTICIPANTS TO CONFORM TO NORMS.
<P>
        The surprising trend that people are more friendly, emotional, 
and expressive in this decentered medium highlights deep 
inadequacies and disintegration in present real-world societies.  
The promise of Computer Socializing is that, should MUD become more 
widespread, it could become an important SUPPLEMENT TO REAL LIFE.  
If this new communication medium, one that merges literary and oral 
strengths, is in fact closer to human thought, and represents a MORE 
GENUINE FORM OF EXPRESSION, perhaps cyberspace will be the choice 
location to meet and develop relationships with real-world others.  
And perhaps our real world will gradually be shaped by tendencies of 
the Net, just as telephone and television technologies have 
influenced our view of ourselves and our surroundings.''
[<A HREF="node68.html#YOUNG94">Young, 1994</A>, lines 70ff.,].
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Young's claim is probably somewhat too strong. He should not forget
that each MOO tries to force a certain style on its participants (and
that it has the means to do so, see for example
chapter <A HREF="node51.html#chasocial">9</A> for more, e.g.  the section on
manners [<A HREF="node59.html#secManners">9.3</A>].
<P>
However, MOOs can certainly play a wonderful rule to bring disabled
people in touch with the world. A good example are blinds. With the
help of specialized terminals and/or speech syntheziers they can
interact in the same way as any other participant. DU has made this
an important issue:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> ``In future editions you will read how DU and other MUDs are being
redesigned in sometimes apparently invisible ways to better serve
people with disabilities and by people you might never expect. You
will be touched as I was by Samantha's article &quot;How I lost 20 pounds
on the New MOO Diet&quot;, an account of how the ability of the MUD
environment to provide accomodation had a vital impact on the physical
life of a person.  Dr. Zenhausern's article in this issue sheds
considerable light on a disability that many of use who swear by
computers may even have and not realize.  Computers can be used as
assistive devices in more ways than most of us realize.''

</BLOCKQUOTE>

Samantha Scolamiero([<A HREF="node68.html#SAMANTHA94">Scolamiero, 1994</A>]) shows with her own experience that
her activity on a MOO did not just gave her access to a better virtual
world, but that this contact had strong therapeutic effects: A few quotes
are an indicator of the progression detailed in this article.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> ``Cyberspace empowers the disABLED. Those who cannot, CAN in cyberspace.
Someone with cognitive overload can maintain an active social life
because they can control their environment. A person who must always
rely on a wheelchair in real life can run and jump and play at the
MOO, just like everyone else. A person whose hearing is impaired can
now &quot;listen&quot; to a group conversation in room full of talkative people.
Can you imagine the impact these newfound freedoms have on people's
perception of themselves and ultimately upon their lives???''
([<A HREF="node68.html#SAMANTHA94">Scolamiero, 1994</A>, 43,])
<P>
``Diversity University gave me my personality back. I can exercise the
REAL me who is unfortunately trapped by a brain that doesn't work like
it used to.  It gave me back real life capabilities. I can run around
the campus meeting every one, talking and socializing, like the maniac
that I am, but in silence. It is the social environment I desperately
needed that is not physically debilitating or painful.''
([<A HREF="node68.html#SAMANTHA94">Scolamiero, 1994</A>, 43,])
<P>
``Using the MOO technology I saw my productivity increase. I saw the
differences between trying to manage in real life and managing better
with computer assistance. This realization gave me the confidence to
try other &quot;assistive&quot; technology. I finally broke down and got a
walking stick. (Don't call it a cane or I will bop you with it.)
Now I can walk longer distances and therefore I get more exercise.
THAT is how I lost 20 pounds on &quot;The New MOO Diet.&quot;  :-)''
([<A HREF="node68.html#SAMANTHA94">Scolamiero, 1994</A>, 43,])
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Heather J. Kelley argues, that despite many cultural and technical
limitations, MOOs could become a vector for social services:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> ``MOOs are real-time, incorporating a sense of spatiality and an
  attendant privacy, as such they are ideally suited to facilitate
  close personal interactions between physically remote participants.
  Concurrently, the anonymity of M*s encourages lowered social
  inhibitions to some degree, enabling users to divulge information
  about themselves that they might otherwise be uncomfortable
  reporting. Given this quality, MOOs are particularly appropriate to
  distance counseling or therapy, and might be appropriate for
  remotely situated 12-step participants or homebound senior citizens.''
 ([<A HREF="node68.html#KELLEY94">Kelley, 1994</A>]).
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
As Kelley points out, in this case a MUD has be be made secure for
people seeking help and she cites an incident on JennyMUSH, a MUD
dedicated to the counseling of sexual trauma victims.  ``My point then
is that, while MOOs tend to encourage social freedom of a positive
kind, in absence of fear of rejection, it also encourages emotional
behaviors of a different sort, in absence of constraints to prevent
abuse'' ([<A HREF="node68.html#KELLEY94">Kelley, 1994</A>]). Despite those and other questions she
raises, the authors concludes here paper with the following paragraph:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> ``While remaining conscious and cautious, I believe that M*s provide
  a special kind of interaction unavailable elsewhere from which
  certain varieties of (underfunded) service organizations could
  benefit to degree disproportionate to the low cost of participating.
  While I realize the inability of MOO and Unix code to serve every
  disadvantaged individual, I see potential for the presence of
  real-time textual worlds to assist the purposes of social service
  organizations. The grassroots, home built nature of both Unix and
  MOOcode leave space for wider, more diverse participation in the
  virtual community even while the culturally specific origins of the
  two media suggest otherwise.  ASCII, Unix, and MOOcode are not
  digital blank slates, but their particular characteristics can
  provide foundational material for organized social change to be
  enacted by individuals separated by great distances. Most
  importantly, the real-time virtual presence of physically distant
  human beings, which only M*s can easily and convincingly provide,
  can create impetus for oppositional methodologies of on-line
  activity to develop and come to fruition. Only through direct and
  multiple person-to-person interactions can the dominant culture's
  unidirectional ideal of 'information' be abandoned for the
  challenging but far more equitable &quot;decentralized community of
  understanding.&quot; ''
