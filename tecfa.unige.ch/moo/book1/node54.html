Let's start with a little digression:
[<A HREF="node68.html#UNSWORTH95">Unsworth, 1995</A>] locates the roots of the MOOs in the Unix Operating
System (itself an outgrowth of capitalist philosophy) and points out
a major paradox of this ``third order simulacrum'' of the world:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> ``If we consider all these factors together, the paradoxes are
  striking. On the one hand, as a mental representation of the
  universe of information, Unix is deeply indebted to culturally
  determined notions such as private property, class membership, and
  hierarchies of power and effectivity. Most of these ideas are older
  than the modern Western culture that produced Unix, but the
  constellation of cultural elements gathered together in Unix's basic
  operating principles seems particularly Western and capitalist-not
  surprisingly, given that its creators were human extensions of one
  of the largest accumulations of capital in the Western world. On the
  other hand, this tool, shaped though it was by the notions of
  ownership and exclusivity, spawned a culture of cooperation, of
  homemade code, of user-contributed modifications and improvements
  (viz. the canonical /contrib/bin in Unix filesystems, where
  user-contributed programs are stored) -in short, of &quot;fellowship.&quot;
  And finally, in some sense it is true, as Guattari suggests, that
  the entire assemblage of causes for Unix is an instance of machines
  speaking to machines, or needing to speak to machines, with humans
  as the midwife at this precarious and unlikely birth''
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Tensions between maintaing the world and some ethic of information
sharing, between being able to do ``anyhing'' and the need for
maintaing personalities and social rules or at a more technical level
between individual freedom to produce objects and protection of those
objects can be felt on any MOO.
