A major problem on giving classes on the MOO is to insure that other
users on a MOO don't disturb. §First of all users of a ``serious'' MOO
(as well as on other MOOs can be trained to respect certain rules,
i.e. to knock before entering a ``closed'' room.
<P>
Furthermore, certain types of rooms such as the ``Generic Classroom''
can be closed by the authorized instructor or he can expel people
if needed. Also, as Marcus Speh (posting on *General@DU) noticed:
``As a first step towards a better 'indoor policy', people should check 
their own 'arrive_msg' and 'join_msg' properties, some of which are excessive.''
<P>
MOO Teachers need to be trained both in using educational artifacts
and MOO netiquette. 
Tari Fanderclai (University of Louisville) has been recruited on DU
to help organize the business of coming up with policies for teachers
and their classes who use DU, and a program for orienting and 
preparing those teachers. See the *MOOteaching list
and  Zak' MOOteach Learning Center (@go #1578) both on DU for further
details.
<P>
Tari Fanderclai in *MOOteach@DU(5, Dec 16 94) listed some things needed in
order to avoid problems with MOO classes:
<PRE>---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[...]

``---Require that teachers be familiar with MOOetiquette and basic
MOOcommands, plus whatever more advanced MOOoperations they might
require their students to use.
---Require that teachers provide their students with documents on
MOOmanners and the MOOcommands they need (they should have a way to
print these, esp. the commands; new users usually work better with
printed info); perhaps also an easy way to get the MOO programming
manual--e.g., a copy on-line locally or FTP instructs for getting it.
        Requirements like the above can't really be enforced, but can
   be made known as responsibilities teachers are assumed to take on.
---If we decide to have special teacher commands and/or special 
classrooms, teachers could be required to complete a tutorial in 
ZAK's MOOteach center that teaches use of those.
---One way to make sure that teachers have a thought-out plan (in my 
experience, students sent onto M*s without directions/something to 
accomplish are generally disruptive and not only to their own class)
would be to ask that they submit a short description of what their 
students will be asked to do in their first couple of visits.  While
we can't exactly judge a lesson plan, asking to see that one exists
should be sufficient.''

<P>
After discussion the following statement was published 
by Tari Fanderclai on the
same list (*MOOteach@DU 23, Jan 14 94):
<P>
<PRE>---------------------------------------------------------------------------

****************************************
DU welcomes classes of all kinds, and does its best to accommodate
a wide variety of teachers' methods and philosophies.  It is 
assumed that a teacher who wishes to bring classes to DU will
spend time getting to know the social, political, and technical
environment here her/himself before leading students in.
Teachers who bring classes to DU have these responsibilities:
---To familiarize their students with the etiquette of DU and 
to make sure the students understand that they are responsible
to behave appropriately or suffer the consequences outlined
by the wizards.
---To teach their students the &quot;MOOoperations&quot; the
students will need to use for their class, and to 
provide those students who want it information beyond what
the class is actually using.  For example, even if the students
are not being asked to build or program, they should know how
to use the help screens and where to get the programmers
manual and all the other help sources available.
---To check news and other information sources frequently so
that they are aware of new DU procedures, events, and other 
important information.
---To comply with policies and procedures set by the wizards,
and to see that their students do also.  Where a student becomes
a problem to the DU community, the student's teacher is expected to
cooperate with the wizards in their decisions about the problem.

We also hope that each teacher who uses DU will make a contribution
to the DU community as a whole.  For example, they could bring
useful ideas to teachers' meetings; volunteer for projects;
agree to be an Official Helpful Person; build or program an object
that becomes a permanent part of DU, etc.  We believe that it is 
important that each teacher becomes a part of the DU community.
