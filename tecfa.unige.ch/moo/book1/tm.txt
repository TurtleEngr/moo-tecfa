VERY  Rough  and  quite  empty  Draft  -  better  wait  until  end  of  May  95.   Parts
of  it  has  been  presented  at  the  MOO  Workshop1  at  FLISH  95.   At  this  stage,
actual  writing  is  ``the  crime''  of  D.S.  and  has  not  yet  been  approved  or
modifyed  by  the  co-authors.   Sorry  for  spelling  and  grammar  !
The   TECFAMOO  is  a  text-based  virtual  reality2.   It  is  a  Virtual  Space  for
Educational  Technology,  Education,  Research  and  Life  at  TECFA,  School  of
Psychology  and  Education,  University  of  Geneva,  Switzerland.
In  this  ``evolving  book''  we  state  the  initial  mission  of  this  MOO  as
related  to  our  research3  in  computer  mediated  communication4,  to  its  use  as
communication  tool  for  our  diploma  in  educational  technology5  and  to
student  projects  in  the  STAF-146  course.
The  main  purpose  of  ``book''  is  to  look  at  a  certain  number  of
``interesting''  topics.   Note  that  this  ``book''  is  not  meant  to  be  a
finished  product,  but  rather  a  collection  of  thoughts,  observations  that
can  be  reused  in  the  future  as  a  resource.   Note  that  screen  dumps  from
various  MOO  may  have  changed.   They  are  here  to  illustrate  principles.
This  book  can  bee  seen  as  complement  to  TECFA's  WWW  page  on  educational
MUDs7.

Chapter  1



Introduction



1.1    The  birth  of   TECFAMOO


The   TECFAMOO  project  has  been  started  as  a  small  informal  project  in  the
fall  of  1994.   Currently  we  have  been  using  MOO  technology  as  CMC  tool  for
our  own  teaching  and  research.   Since  April  1st  1995  our  MOO  has  become  the
main  technical  vector  in  an  effort  to  create  a  virtual  space  for  European
researchers  and  practitioners  in  Educational  Technology.   This  project  is
supported  partly  by  the  European  VMDL  (``Virtual  Mobility  and  Distance
Learning''  project.   MOO  technology  also  plays  a  major  role  in  three
European  4th  framework  bids  (LEARN-NETT,  European  University  Network  for
Trainers,  VORTEX,  Distributed  European  Research  Laboratories  EUCOSITY,  An
European  Collaborative  Tele-University)
Since  April  24  (!)   the   TECFAMOO  has  an  experimental  World-Wide  Web
interface  allowing  to  take  increased  benefits  from  both  technologies.   This
latest  development  will  increase  our  commitment  to  MOO  technology
TECFAMOO  is  largely  an  international  project.   Its  main  contributors  are
the  authors  of  this  report.


1.2    A  List  of  ``Questions''


Creation  of   TECFAMOO  has  been  started  in  fall  1994  without  precise
purpose.   It  seemed  to  us  that  MOO  technology  had  a  promise  for  several
purposes  and  and  it  seemed  appropriate  to  have  a  MOO  handy  that  could  be
used  whenever  needed.   Since  TECFA's  mission  is  research  and  education  in
Educational  Technology  such  an  ``exploratory  stance''  could  easily  justify
the  investment  needed.
What  could  we  use  our  MOO  for  ?


    o  The  MOO  as  internal  communication  tool.   See  for  instance
       [EVARD,  1993    ].

    o  Support  for  international  exchange  Research  and  Development:   A
       project  (see  3.1.2)  on  using   TECFAMOO  for  various  research  groups  in
       Education  Technology  has  started  in  April  95.


        --   Virtual  Cafes,  i.e.   place  where  people  from  various  fields  can
             meet  in  an  informal  way.

        --   Collaborative  work


    o  Education

        --   Tutorial  support  for  semi-distance  class-room  teaching:   This  item
             is  of  interest  for  our  diploma  in  educational  technology.


                                                       9

10                                                                       CHAPTER  1.     INTRODUCTION



        --   Tutorial  support  for  distance  teaching

        --   Environments  for  ``Just-in-Time-Open  Learning'',  e.g.   resource
             centers.

        --   Educational  Environments  (Learning  by  doing)

    o  The  MOO  as  information  tool


        --   A  Spatial  Integrator  for  Information  Retrieval  and  Exchange:   This
             becomes  a  very  ``hot''  topic  for  ``webbed''  MOOs.   See  for
             instance  one  of  Dieberger's1  articles  (e.g.
             [DIEBERGER  et  TROMP,  1993        ],  [DIEBERGER,  1994a      ]  and
             [DIEBERGER,  1994b      ])  for  a  general  discussion  of  ``spatial''  hyper
             media.

        --   ``Exhibition  of  activities'',  related  to  the  previous  item  this
             means  that  organizations  can  build  virtual  information  centers  on
             the  MOO.


    o  Interesting  other  issues

    o  Dynamics  of  interactions  in  a  virtual  space

    o  Social  and  Political  issues  in  virtual  worlds


[...   more  to  come]


1.3    This  is  *not*  an  article!


As  stated  in  the  abstract,  this  report  is  not  meant  to  be  an  ``article''
but  rather  a  collection  of  thoughts,  observations  that  can  be  reused  in  the
future.   Note  that  screen  dumps  from  various  MOO  may  have  changed  and
postings  to  various  MOO  mailing  lists  may  have  disappeared.   They  are  here
to  illustrate  principles.
We  took  the  liberty  to  quote  in  length  descriptions,  postings  and  so  forth
found  in  various  public  MOOs.   We  feel  that  those  quotes  illustrate  the
richness  of  text-based  virtual  realities  and  they  constitute  an  an
important  source  for  discussing  or  building  up  ``serious''  MOOs.   Readers,
please  note  that  some  of  those  quotes  do  not  come  from  ``polished''
articles  and  they  have  to  be  interpreted  as  contributions  to  on-going
discussions.
Quotations  allow  to  find  the  original.   Excerpts  from  mailing  lists  use  the
following  syntax:   <MOO  mailing  list>@<name  of  the  MOO>  (article  number,
date).

Chapter  2



On  Building  a  MOO



2.1    First  Time  Users  and/or  Beginners


Several  places  and  features  are  important  for  first  time  users:

  1.   The  ``Welcome  Screen''  which  is  displayed  before  connecting  with  a
       character  to  the  MOO

  2.   The  ``Welcome  Area''  where  people  land  when  they  connect  (unless  they
       built  a  ``home''.

  3.   Tools  for  assistance  and  visitor  centers  around  the  welcome  area

  4.   General  information  tools  such  as  mailing  lists,  maps  and  so  on

  5.   ``Tour  buses''  or  equivalent  that  give  people  a  guided  tour  to
       interesting  places

  6.   Tutorials  and  guidelines  for  using  the  MOO  and  building  rooms  and
       objects

This  section  is  based  partly  on  an  assignment  in  the  STAF-141  class.   We
gave  a  short  introduction  to  our  students  on  how  to  navigate  in  the  MOO
world  and  then  asked  them  to  visit  a  few  MOOs  and  evaluate  it  among  a  few
criteria,  among  which  ``how  beginners  are  handled''.


2.1.1     The  Welcome  Screen

The  welcome  screen  should  give  some  information  on  the  purpose  of  the  MOO
and  tell  people  (including  guests)  how  to  connect  (or  how  to  obtain  a
character).   Most  MOOs  have  a  set  of  standard  commands  enabled  like  ``who''
displaying  who  is  on  the  MOO.
Let's  look  a  few  of  those  screens:

2.1.2     The  Welcome  Area

We  could  observe  several  models  for  the  welcome  area:

  1.   Most  educational  MOOs  have  people  land  in  area  which  gives  access  to  a
       lot  of  information.   Sometimes  (as  in  Collegetown  shown  in  figure  2.1)
       this  area  is  also  a  central  room  of  the  MOO.

  2.   Culture  and  leisure  MOOs  more  often  tend  to  let  people  arrive  in  a
       ``closet''  or  other  room  devoid  of  interest.   A  visitors  is  center  is
       sometimes  adjacent  sometimes  not  and  it  has  to  be  found.

  3.   Others  like  Diversity  University  MOO  and  more  so  EON  have  a  ``stage''
       approach.

Let's  now  have  a  closer  look  a  Diversity  University  MOO  (DUM).  DUM  is
interesting  because  of  its  size  and  solutions  found  there  may  be  of  general
interest.   At  DUM  one  lands  first  in  a  general  welcome  room  which  has  been
rather  designed  to  keep  certain  behavior  or  people  from  this  MOO.


-------------------------------------------------------------------  DU  4/95


                       *****  DIVERSITY  UNIVERSITY  IS  NOT  A  GAME  *****


It  is  a  place  where  many  people  from  various  backgrounds  come  to  do  work  and
interact  in  a  mature  and  responsible  environment,  and  as  a  visitor  you  are
expected  to  behave  in  an  appropriate  manner.


    Swearing,  offensive  language,  obscenity,  harassment,  and  rudeness  will
    not  be  tolerated  here.   If  you  must  do  that,  do  it  somewhere  else.


 If  you're  not  sure  if  something  is  ok  or  not,  ASK  FIRST.   If  someone  asks
 you  to  stop  doing  something  they  find  objectionable,  STOP.   For  a  more
 complete  list  of  what  behavior  is  and  is  not  considered  appropriate  here,
 type  'help  manners'  once  connected.


NOTE:   You  can  and  will  be  booted  off  the  system  and  barred  further  access  to
          this  MOO  if  you  cannot  behave  responsibly.   Under  some  circumstances
          your  actions  on  this  system  can  be  logged  or  monitored  as  well.  Your
          connection  site  is  being  displayed  in  your  description;  anyone  can
          see  where  you  are  connected  from.


If  you  do  not  wish  to  agree  to  these  conditions,  type  @quit  to  leave  the  MOO.

Diversity  University  is  currently  the  biggest  Educational  MOO  and  several
information  and  navigation  tools  had  to  be  created.   Of  particular
interests  are:


    o  DU  Places  of  interest  (poi):   An  index  of  major  educational  activities
       allowing  to  jump  to  the  location  in  question.



    o  The  yellow  pages:   A  directory  of  people,  places  and  things



2.1.3     Work  in  progress


When  we  sent  out  our  students  to  look  at  MOOs  in  December  1994  after  a  2
hour  MOO  training  session  most  students  found  that  handling  of  beginners
and  more  so  of  first  time  users  was  insufficient.   Despite  having  pointed
out  ``Diversity  University''  as  the  primary  educational  MOO,  our  students
were  somewhat  ``afraid''  of  it.   Since  then,  a  lot  of  improvement  could  be
observed  on  this  MOO  (see:   section  2.1.2).

Collegetown  (among  the  MOOs  studied)  overally  got  the  best  marks,  also  for
its  general  ergonomics.   Since  some  of  out  students  were  psychology
students  EON's  stage  model  (see  section  4.2.4)  was  found  to  be  interesting.
However,  it  was  noted  that  EON  needs  a  lot  of  involvement  and  one  student
who  tried  to  learn  something  about  Unix  by  looking  at  an  ``aircraft
carrier''  complained  about  feeling  really  lost.

2.2.   COMMUNICATION  AND  NAVIGATION  ON  THE  MOO                                          17



2.2    Communication  and  Navigation  on  the  MOO


2.3    Topology  and  Navigation


``Topology''  is  very  important  issue  since  the  MOO  has  a  spatial
orientation  and  since  ``places''  in  real  life  always  have  certain  ``uses''.
By  defining  a  global  topology  rooster  and  building  rules  in  a  MOO  one
addresses  several  related  questions:


  1.   User  Interface  issues

  2.   Navigational  Issues  (how  do  we  want  people  to  move)

  3.   ``Urban  planning''  issues:   What  activities  where

  4.   ``Social  and  political  Issues'':   What  can  be  built?

  5.   .....


Among  educational  MOOs  one  can  find  several  kinds  of  topologies.


The  ``Campus''  Model         The  best  known  example  is  the  Diversity  University
       MOO.  It  is  modeled  after  a  typical  American  Campus.   Another  example
       is  the  Bio  MOO.

The  ``Chamber''  Model         Certain  activities  are  confined  to  areas.   At  EON  for
       example,  those  areas  are  reachable  by  a  train  and  access  is
       controlled.

The  ``City  or  World''  Model          This  is  the  model  adopted  by   TECFAMOO  .  There
       are  reserved  areas  for  academic  work  (both  teaching  and  research)  but
       the  MOO  is  also  designed  to  be  a  social  space.   We  fully  agree  with
       this  quote  from  College  Town:

                 [...]   Recognizing  that  a  great  deal  of  real  research  and
             learning  goes  on  'outside  the  classroom'  we  are  augmenting  the
             classrooms  with  a  realistic  nurturant  community.   Creative
             thinking  may  find  its  freeest  play  while  walking  on  a  beach
             and  a  small  seminar  may  become  much  more  meaningful  if  hosted
             at  a  colleague's  home  in  the  woods...

A  combined  Campus  and  City  Model


2.3.1     Building  on  CollegeTown

Among  all  educational  MOOs,  College  Town  probably  comes  closest  to
TECFAMOO  .  There  are  differences,  e.g.   building  rules  at  TECFA  are  (and
will  probably  remain)  less  strict  (e.g.   geography  can  spread  out  of
Geneva,  and  even  known  space  and  time)  and  we  do  not  plan  make  available
our  MOO  to  very  young  kids.
Here  are  CollegeTown's  building  rules  as  of  March  27  1995:

-----------------------------------------------------------------  CT  4/95


>look  building
   1)  All  rooms  and  objects  must  comply  with  our  overall  theme.  We  are  a
       small  college  town  situated  in  the  scenic  countryside.  Our  mission  is
       to  provide  a  platform  for  academic  research  and  learning.  Recognizing

18                                                                CHAPTER  2.     ON  BUILDING  A  MOO



       that  a  great  deal  of  real  research  and  learning  goes  on  'outside  the
       classroom'  we  are  augmenting  the  classrooms  with  a  realistic  nurturant
       community.  Creative  thinking  may  find  its  freeest  play  while  walking
       on  a  beach  and  a  small  seminar  may  become  much  more  meaningful  if
       hosted  at  a  colleague's  home  in  the  woods...
   2)  All  rooms  must  be  connected.  (Ask  any  wiz  for  assistance.)
       Every  exit  should  be  listed/shown.   Hidden  exits  are  discouraged.
       'Leave',  'oleave',  and  'oarrive'  messages  should  be  set  on  each  exit.
   3)  Room  descriptions  should  be  a  combination  of  text/graphics  not  to
       exceed  20  lines.  Rationale:  The  average  screen  holds  24  lines  of  text.
       One  line  is  used  for  the  name  of  the  room  and  at  least  3  lines  should  be
       reserved  for  listing  contents  and  occupants.
   4)  The  spatial  integrity  of  the  moo  *must*  be  respected.  If  your  house  is
       in  the   Primeval  Forest  you  cannot  logically  have  an  exit  to  the
       Western  Shore  <grin>.  Fantastical  teleport  type  exits  are  discouraged.
   5)  Generally  one  room  is  sufficient  for  a  house.
       Use  'out'  to  leave  your  house.
       Housing  Sites  are  listed  in  the  HOUSING  INFO  bulletin.
   6)  Please  remember  that  this  MOO  serves  children  as  well  as  adults.  Do
       not  build  anything  you  would  not  want  your  own  child  to  encounter.  Rooms
       have  a  special  toggle  that  you  can  set  to  keep  kids  out  if  there  is  any
       question.
   7)  Because  of  our  realistic  environment  we  encourage  REAL  NAMES,  common
       nicknames,  or  real  name  variants.  We  are  not  a  phantasy  moo.
   8)  The  building  of  weapons  is  expressly  forbidden.
   9)  Additional  quota  may  be  requested  for  building  rooms  and  objects  in  the
       public  interest,  subject  to  wiz/council  review.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


2.3.2     Building  Rules  on   TECFAMOO

There  are  a  few  basic  rules  for  building  in  the   TECFAMOO  which  builders
should  follow:

  1.   The  topology  of  Geneva  has  to  be  vaguely  respected.

  2.   Certain  types  of  activities  should  be  restricted  to  certain  areas.
       The  major  focus  of  this  MOO  is  exchange  in  educational  technology,
       education  and  research.   However  other  activities  are  welcome  too.

  3.   All  major  education  and  research  activities  should  take  place  in  the
       virtual  "Geneva  Basin"  (see  the  next  page).   They  will  be  connected
       with  a  room  (currently  the  "underground  corridor")  or  a  similar
       ``direct  access''  artifact.

  4.   Strange  stuff  can  be  added,  but  preferrably  "outside"  of  Geneva.   An
       airport,  a  trainstation  and  such  will  be  provided.

Education  and  Research  Activities  in  the   TECFAMOO  are  centered  around  a
few  areas.   Currently,  there  are  several  sites  planned  for  such  activities:

    o  People  form  the  U  of  Geneva  (including  TECFA)  should  use  the  locations
       of  their  real  buildings  (although  they  may  be  enhanced).

MOOs  for  Research  Work



3.1    Virtual  Meeting  Spaces


The  concept  of  ``Virtual  Meeting  Space''  covers  several  possible  setups  for
synchronous  communication  among  communities:

    o  ``Virtual  Cafes''  are  places  where  people  can  hang  out  and  meet  in
       very  informal  ways  in  a  similar  fashion  as  in  corridors  of  a
       conference  or  in  the  cafeteria  of  a  university.   Since  on  most
       ``serious  MUDS''  people  have  descriptions  of  their  research  interests
       which  can  be  accessed  either  by  ``looking''  at  a  person  or  by  using  a
       command  like  ``whois  xxx'',  ``finger  xxx''  contacts  of  persons  sharing
       the  similar  interest  are  even  easier  than  in  real  life.

    o  ``Virtual  Lobbies''  or  similar  ``rooms''  can  be  used  to  display
       information  about  an  organization.   A  good  example  is  ``GNA  Central''
       (#4156)  at  Diversity  University  MOO.

    o  A  similar  function  is  fulfilled  by  ``Resource  Centers''.   A  good
       example  is  the  Ed-Tech  Resource  Center  (#15169)  on  Diversity
       University  MOO.

    o  ``Meetings  Rooms''  fulfill  the  same  function  as  real  ones,  i.e.
       provide  space  for  regular  meetings.   Such  rooms  can  be  structured  by
       adding  ``tables''  (a  device  for  group  discussion),  white-boards,
       projection  devices  and  such.

    o  ``Offices''  can  be  used  for  meeting  persons  in  a  private  space,  ``idle
       quietly'',  or  for  providing  more  information  about  a  person.   An
       office  also  adds  an  anthropological  touch  by  providing  a  ``home''
       where  characters  can  connect  to  and  ``sleep''.


3.1.1     A  look  at  other  MOOs

MOOs  as  virtual  meeting  spaces  for  professional  communities  are  becoming
increasingly  popular.   Well  known  examples  are  the  MediaMOO1  (Media
Researchers),  AstroMOO2  (Astronomers),  BioMOO3  (Biologists)  and  PMCMOO4
(Post  Modern  Culture).
Let's  have  a  look  at  the  purpose  of  MediaMOO  (obtained  by  typing  ``help
purpose''):

--------------------------------------------------------------  Media  MOO  4/95


>help  purpose


MediaMOO  is  a  professional  community  for  media  researchers.   It  is  a  place  to
come  meet  colleagues  in  media  studies  and  related  fields  and  brainstorm,  to
hold  colloquia  and  conferences,  to  explore  the  serious  side  of  this  new
medium.


Unlike  other  MUDs,  characters  on  MediaMOO  are  identified.   You  can  find  out
who  anyone  is  with  the  @whois  command  (except  for  a  few  early  members  who  are
still  anonymous)  so  that  you  can  contact  them  to  continue  professional
discussions.


To  become  a  member  of  MediaMOO  you  must  be  doing  media  research.   We  are  more
interested  in  knowing  about  what  you  are  doing  than  what  you  are  interested
in.  Most  college  and  pre-college  students  who  apply  are  not  really  doing  media
research.


If  you're  looking  for  a  place  to  hang  out  with  interesting  people,  LambdaMOO
is  at  lambda.parc.xerox.com  8888.   In  fact,  if  you  read  the  USENET  newsgroup
rec.games.mud.announce,  you'll  find  a  list  of  hundreds  of  MUDs  and  MOOs,
almost  all  of  which  have  no  requirements  for  membership.


A  note  to  teachers:
Unfortunately,  we  must  discourage  you  from  bringing  classes  of  students  here.
Although  these  experiments  are  interesting,  this  is  not  the  appropriate  place.
MediaMOO  would  become  a  very  different  place  if  it  were  filled  with,  for
example,  hundreds  of  freshman  composition  students.


Welcome!


Sincerely,


Amy  Bruckman

This  message  written  in  1993  clearly  tries  to  emphasize  distinction  between
a  place  dedicated  to  one  specific  task  (being  a  place  for  a  community)  and
multi-purpose  MOOs  such  as   TECFAMOO  .
BioMOO  shows  a  similar  statement,  but  is  also  used  for  educational
purposes.

3.1.2     Meeting  Spaces  at   TECFAMOO

One  of  the  motivations  for  creating   TECFAMOO  has  been  the  creation  of  a
virtual  space  for  researchers  and  practitioners  in  Educational  Technology.
This  project  is  supported  partly  by  the  VMDL  (``Virtual  Mobility  and
Distance  Learning''  project.
[More  to  come:   Sandrine  Tognotti5  will  work  on  this]
We  plan  to  let  organizations  such  as  GNA  build  campuses.

MOOs  for  Education



4.1    Virtual  Classrooms


Virtual  Classrooms  are  probably  the  theme  best  developed  in  the  Educational
MOO  community.   Based  on  earlier  work  at  Lambda-MOO  and  other  almost
mythical  MOOs,  a  certain  number  of  people  like  Ken  Schweller1  or  DaveM  []
have  developed  very  interesting  artifacts  for  teaching  and  tutoring  in  the
MOO.  Most  of  those  objects  can  be  found  on  DU  4.1.1  but  many  have  also
found  their  way  into  other  MOOs.   Also,  consult  the  *MOOteach  mailing  list
on  DU.
At   TECFAMOO  we  made  enthusiastic  use  of  the  Tutorial  Room  and  a  Generic
Classroom  which  are  put  up  on  display  in  our  MOOseum.
A  very  useful  tool  not  just  in  virtual  class-  and  tutoring  rooms  are  the
www-slates  (by  shkoo@eon)  which  allow  accessing  www  pages  from  within  the
MOO.  Those  slates  can  be  ``pretuned''  (or  book-marked)  to  a  set  of  pages,
so  that  teachers  can  put  on  display  somewhat  preconfigured  www-boxes  in
certain  areas  of  the  MOO.
Note  that  virtual  classrooms  and  similar  artifacts  are  not  *the*  only  way
to  use  a  MOO.  After  all  they  just  replicate  more  or  less  traditional
teaching  via  distance.   See  section  4.2  for  a  start  on  other  directions.


4.1.1     Education  Tools  at  Diversity  University

Donald,  in  his  Education  MOOs  and  Tools2  article  quotes  a  number
educational  artifacts  available  at  DU:

4.1.2     Ken's  generic  classroom

Todays  (April  95)  probably  best  tested,  liked  and  known  classroom  has  been
built  by  Ken  Schweller3.
Upon  creation  of  a  classroom  a  short  tutorial  and  help  is  available:


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


>@tutorial
*  *  *  *  *  *     Using  the  GENERIC  CLASSROOM  :  A  Brief  Tutorial     *  *  *  *  *  *  *
       The  Generic  Classroom  was  created  to  give  teachers  greater  flexibility,
 creativity  and  control  in  conducting  MOO  classes.   Here  are  the  basics  of
classroom  use.  You  may  type  'help  here'  at  any  time  for  a  brief  summary  of
the  room  commands.
DESIGNING  THE  CLASSROOM:
       You  may  create  your  own  desks,  tables,  shelves,  bulletin  boards,  walls
or  whatever  using  the  @addfurniture  command.  Let's  suppose  you  wished  to
add  a  Lab  Table  to  the  room.   After  typing  '@addfurniture  Lab  Table'  you
would  be  asked  to  describe  the  table  and  indicate  whether  it  is  'sit-able'
or  not.  While  most  furniture  is  'sit-table'  some  things  like  walls  and
bulletin  boards  are  clearly  not.   Students  can  'sit  Lab  Table',  'put
<anything>  on  Lab  Table',  'get  <anything>',  or  'look  Lab  Table'.   Objects  on
the  Lab  Table  will  only  be  seen  by  persons  sitting  there  or  persons  who  look
at  the  table.   Walls,  shelves,  and  bulletin  boards  are  obvious  places  to
'put'  things  like  calendars,  lab  equipment,  or  notes.  To  remove  furniture
type  '@rmfurniture  <object>'.  Note  that  each  room  has  a  built  in  blackboard
and  a  clock.   Just  'look  blackboard'  or  'look  clock'.   You  can  write  on  the
blackboard  by  typing  'writeb  hello  class!'.
SETTING  UP  A  CLASS  ROSTER:
       To  set  up  an  'Intro  to  Theater'  class  type  '@mkclass  Intro  to  Theater'.
This  creates  a  class  roster  for  registering  your  students.   If  you  would  like
Ken  to  be  able  to  teach  a  different  class  in  your  room  you  must  '@authorize
Ken'.   This  enables  Ken  to  use  the  @mkclass  and  other  commands  to  create  his
own  class.  You  can  now  register  your  students.   Type  '@setup  Intro'  to
activate  Intro  to  Theater  as  the  'current'  class  and  then  type   'register
Bill',  'register  Mary',  and  so  on.  Students  registered  in  the  'current'  class
can   enter  the  classroom  even  when  the  door  is  closed.  To  allow  only
authorized  persons  to  make  furniture,  register  students  or  setup  classes  just
type  '@restrictions  on'.  You  may  type  '@status'  at  any  time  to  see  which  class
is  'current',  who  is  registered  or  authorized,  and  whether  restrictions  are  in
place.
MODERATING  THE  CLASS:
       One  of  the  main  advantages  of  using  the  Generic  Classroom  is  to  moderate
extraneous  talking  and  emoting.   Have  the  students  'sit  Lab  Table'  or
wherever.   While  they  are  seated  they  can  only  be  heard  by  others  sitting
with  them.   This  enables  students  to  talk  with  each  other  or  carry  on  small
group  discussions  without  disturbing  others.   Students  who  wish  to  be  heard
throughout  the  room  need  only  'speakup  <anything>',  or  'stand'  to  be  heard.
Emoting  can  be  limited  to  tablemates  only  or  made  visible  to  the  entire  room
through  the  use  of  '@stifle  on/off'.
It  is  a  good  idea  to  type  'door  close'  and  '@sign  on'  when  you  begin  a  class
so  folks  not  registered  in  the  'current'  class  cannot  drop  in  uninvited.  The
@sign  command  informs  others  that  your  class  is  '(in  session)'  when  they  do

an  @who  listing.
MISC:
       There  are  numerous  additional  commands  that  can  be  used  in  the  Generic
Classroom.  Type  'help  here'  for  examples  of  their  use.
AN  INVITATION:
       The  Generic  Classroom  was  designed  to  incorporate  the  ideas  and  wishes  of
many  MOO  teachers.   It  will  continue  to  evolve  as  we  all  make  new  teaching
discoveries.  We  invite  *you*  to  participate  in  the  development  of  this
experimental  teaching  technology  by  bringing  forward  your  critiques  and
suggestions.  They  are  most  welcome!   -ken/cdr

Ken's  generic  classroom  has  been  developed  in  tight  interaction  with
teachers  on  DU  and  other  MOOs.



4.1.3     Please  don't  disturb!

A  major  problem  on  giving  classes  on  the  MOO  is  to  insure  that  other  users
on  a  MOO  don't  disturb.   xFirst  of  all  users  of  a  ``serious''  MOO  (as  well
as  on  other  MOOs  can  be  trained  to  respect  certain  rules,  i.e.   to  knock
before  entering  a  ``closed''  room.
Furthermore,  certain  types  of  rooms  such  as  the  ``Generic  Classroom''  can
be  closed  by  the  authorized  instructor  or  he  can  expel  people  if  needed.
Also,  as  Marcus  Speh  (posting  on  *General@DU)  noticed:   ``As  a  first  step

4.1.   VIRTUAL  CLASSROOMS                                                                        29



towards  a  better  'indoor  policy',  people  should  check  their  own
'arrive msg'  and  '______________join_msg'  properties,  some  of  which  are  excessive.''
MOO  Teachers  need  to  be  trained  both  in  using  educational  artifacts  and  MOO
netiquette.   Tari  Fanderclai  (University  of  Louisville)  has  been  recruited
on  DU  to  help  organize  the  business  of  coming  up  with  policies  for  teachers
and  their  classes  who  use  DU,  and  a  program  for  orienting  and  preparing
those  teachers.   See  the  *MOOteaching  list  and  Zak'  MOOteach  Learning
Center  (@go  #1578)  both  on  DU  for  further  details.
Tari  Fanderclai  in  *MOOteach@DU(5,  Dec  16  94)  listed  some  things  needed  in
order  to  avoid  problems  with  MOO  classes:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


[...]


``---Require  that  teachers  be  familiar  with  MOOetiquette  and  basic
MOOcommands,  plus  whatever  more  advanced  MOOoperations  they  might
require  their  students  to  use.
---Require  that  teachers  provide  their  students  with  documents  on
MOOmanners  and  the  MOOcommands  they  need  (they  should  have  a  way  to
print  these,  esp.  the  commands;  new  users  usually  work  better  with
printed  info);  perhaps  also  an  easy  way  to  get  the  MOO  programming
manual--e.g.,  a  copy  on-line  locally  or  FTP  instructs  for  getting  it.
           Requirements  like  the  above  can't  really  be  enforced,  but  can
    be  made  known  as  responsibilities  teachers  are  assumed  to  take  on.
---If  we  decide  to  have  special  teacher  commands  and/or  special
classrooms,  teachers  could  be  required  to  complete  a  tutorial  in
ZAK's  MOOteach  center  that  teaches  use  of  those.
---One  way  to  make  sure  that  teachers  have  a  thought-out  plan  (in  my
experience,  students  sent  onto  M*s  without  directions/something  to
accomplish  are  generally  disruptive  and  not  only  to  their  own  class)
would  be  to  ask  that  they  submit  a  short  description  of  what  their
students  will  be  asked  to  do  in  their  first  couple  of  visits.   While
we  can't  exactly  judge  a  lesson  plan,  asking  to  see  that  one  exists
should  be  sufficient.''


[...]


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

After  discussion  the  following  statement  was  published  by  Tari  Fanderclai
on  the  same  list  (*MOOteach@DU  23,  Jan  14  94):


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


****************************************
DU  welcomes  classes  of  all  kinds,  and  does  its  best  to  accommodate
a  wide  variety  of  teachers'  methods  and  philosophies.   It  is
assumed  that  a  teacher  who  wishes  to  bring  classes  to  DU  will
spend  time  getting  to  know  the  social,  political,  and  technical
environment  here  her/himself  before  leading  students  in.
Teachers  who  bring  classes  to  DU  have  these  responsibilities:
---To  familiarize  their  students  with  the  etiquette  of  DU  and
to  make  sure  the  students  understand  that  they  are  responsible
to  behave  appropriately  or  suffer  the  consequences  outlined

30                                                              CHAPTER  4.     MOOS  FOR  EDUCATION



by  the  wizards.
---To  teach  their  students  the  "MOOoperations"  the
students  will  need  to  use  for  their  class,  and  to
provide  those  students  who  want  it  information  beyond  what
the  class  is  actually  using.   For  example,  even  if  the  students
are  not  being  asked  to  build  or  program,  they  should  know  how
to  use  the  help  screens  and  where  to  get  the  programmers
manual  and  all  the  other  help  sources  available.
---To  check  news  and  other  information  sources  frequently  so
that  they  are  aware  of  new  DU  procedures,  events,  and  other
important  information.
---To  comply  with  policies  and  procedures  set  by  the  wizards,
and  to  see  that  their  students  do  also.   Where  a  student  becomes
a  problem  to  the  DU  community,  the  student's  teacher  is  expected  to
cooperate  with  the  wizards  in  their  decisions  about  the  problem.


We  also  hope  that  each  teacher  who  uses  DU  will  make  a  contribution
to  the  DU  community  as  a  whole.   For  example,  they  could  bring
useful  ideas  to  teachers'  meetings;  volunteer  for  projects;
agree  to  be  an  Official  Helpful  Person;  build  or  program  an  object
that  becomes  a  permanent  part  of  DU,  etc.   We  believe  that  it  is
important  that  each  teacher  becomes  a  part  of  the  DU  community.

4.1.4     So  what  is  new  ?

Educational  activities  on  MOOs  can  be  broadly  distinguished  among  those
who:

    o  try  to  replicate  traditional  class-room  setups


    o  tend  to  use  the  MOO  for  new  ways  of  teaching  and  learning  (and
       therefore  get  away  from  the  ``class-room''  metaphor

However,  one  can  ask  the  question  how  virtual  classrooms  are  different  from
real  ones  and  how  they  could  exploit  extra-potential  from  the  MOOs.   This
latter  question  is  very  important  since  virtual  ``MOO''  classrooms  clearly
have  disadvantages.
Now  several  advantages  of  the  virtual  class  room  could  be  cited,  like  the
following  ones:
(1)  Virtual  Classrooms  in  a  MOO  allow  for  ``layered  communication''  over
different  channels.   This  allows  for  instance  students  to  discuss  among
themselves  without  disturbing  the  class  or  to  isolate  tutor-one  student
interactions  which  are  not  of  general  interest.   More  sophisticated
classrooms  can  be  furnished  with  ``tables''  suited  for  group-work  (a  setup
that  can  be  found  often  in  real  primary  school).
(2)  Provided  that  a  good  Mud  client  is  available  to  the  student,  class-room
teaching  (an  specially  lecturing)  looses  some  of  its  not  always  desired
linearity.   At  anytime  a  student  can  scroll  back  and  (provided  he  can  split
the  screen)  still  monitor  what  is  going  on.
(3)  Along  the  same  lines,  a  virtual  class-room  has  a  ``memory''.   Teachers
do  not  have  to  repeat  things  as  frequently  and  at  the  same  time  things  said
before  can  be  pasted  back  into  the  discussion.

4.2.   MOO  LEARNING  ENVIRONMENTS                                                              31



(4)  Students  may  have  better  access  to  ``external  sources''  such  as  other
tutors,  on-line  books  and  so  during  a  class.
Of  course  there  is  a  limit  to  all  that.   It  is  well  known  that  human
processing  power  is  very  limited  for  structured  cognitive  tasks.   We  can  do
only  a  small  amount  of  things  at  the  same  time.   So  MOO  teachers  whish  to
exploit  those  and  other  extra-functionalities  they  will  have  to  take  into
account  those  limits  and  ``slow  down'',  but  make  sure  that  students  don't
get  bored  or  involved  into  other  activities  at  the  same  time.
In  any  case,  in  most  situations  it  is  probably  best  to  avoid  using  the  MOO
for  lecturing  (that  can  be  done  by  providing  a  text  over  the  WWW)  and  use
those  classrooms  for  more  interactive  tutoring  instead.
Interested  readers  may  want  to  look  at  those  transcripts  from  a
MOO-programming  lesson:   [retrieve  the  thing  from  colin]



4.2    MOO  Learning  Environments


Moos  can  be  used  to  implement  various  sorts  of  interactive  learning
environments,  not  just  sophisticated  text-based  virtual  classrooms.
[FANDERCLAI,  1995      ]  for  instance  makes  this  point  very  clear:   ``I  am
hopeful,  therefore,  that  the  near  future  holds  more  of  these  changes.   MUDs
are  places  for  self-directed  learning,  learning  that  blends  work  and  play,
that  often  looks  chaotic  but  that  is  uniquely  effective.   A  MUD  is  not  an
environment  that  can  be  controlled;  to  use  MUDs  effectively,  educators  must
replace  control  with  structure.''
In  the   TECFAMOO  ,  several  persons  started  building  more  ``theme  oriented''
places  like  the  ``Ticinese''  4.2.2  village  and  the  Social-Psychological
Experiments  4.2.3  within  a  setup  for  an  on-line  class.
Several  examples  of  interactive  exhibits  can  be  found  at  Diversity  MOO.  A
few  of  them  are  related  to  anthropology  (see  for  instance  The  Physical
Anthropology  Hall  (5-6)  #10375).   An  other  nice  example  is  the  interactive
simulation  of  Agincourt  battle  (#3300).   It  allows  users  to  navigate  a
historical  area  and  to  interact  with  objects  and  artificial  people.   Also
interesting  is  the  Rain  Forest  (#8134)  located  off  the  Biology  Hall.
The  Ohlone  Village  at  BayMOO  (see  section  4.2.1)  hanging  off  the  ``Past
Revisited  Room''  also  leading  to  to  ``Gold  Rush  San  Francisco'',  ``Hippie
Haight'',  and  ``City  Lights'',  this  simulation  teaches  the  culture  and  some
of  the  words  of  the  Ohlone  Tribe  that  was  located  in  the  Bay  area.
Interactive  exhibits  are  one  direction  to  go.   More  interesting  are
structures  activities  where  students  have  to  do  something,  cooperatively.
First  of  all,  one  could  consider  every  MOO  as  an  environment  which  teaches
about  itself.   Some  do  it  better  than  others.   One  good  example  is  EON
4.2.4  who  acts  as  a  holistic  environment  to  learn  ``MOOing''  and  ``MOO
programming''.   Hopefully,  MOOs  will  grow  into  more  than  self-centered
constructivism.


4.2.1     The  Ohlone  Village

The  Ohlone  village  (visited  on  5/95)  is  another  interesting  example  of  a
historical  simulation  (Type  'go  ohlone  village'  on  BayMOO  to  get  there).

Ohlone  Village


A  village  of  12  reed  dwellings  at  the  tip  of  the  San  Francisco  peninsula.  In
 the  center  of  the  village,  two  women  are  scooping  acorns  from  their  tule  reed
 baskets.  A  group  of  young  men  hesitate  before  entering  into  the  sweathouse  to
 be  instructed  by  the  tribal  shaman.


 Type   ENTER  to  learn  the  lessons  of  Coyote,  Eagle,  Hummingbird  and  Gismen.


Obvious  exits:  NOONO  to  Ohlone  Language  Pit  House,  PAST  to  The  Past  Revisited,
 and  ENTER  to  Sweathouse


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


The  Ohlone  visage  is  designed  both  as  a  puzzle  and  an  exhibit.   To  enter
certain  rooms,  objects  have  to  be  found  and  carried  by  ``understanding''
and  typing  words  of  the  Ohlone  language.   A  specially  designed
``translation  room''  does  word  to  word  translation  of  some  short  English
sentences.   Look  at  the  next  transcript  for  an  illustation  of  this
principle.



----------------------------------------------------------------  Bay  MOO  5/95


>ENTER
Sweathouse


The  intense  heat  and  thick  redwood  smoke  make  the  interior  of  the  sweathouse
 almost  unbearable.  Through  the  haze  you  can  make  out  bows,  arrows,  clubs  and
 knives  stacked  against  the  earthen  walls.


In  one  corner,  two  hunters  are  conversing  in  Ramaytush,  the  local  Ohlone
 dialect.  One  boasts  that,  in  preparation  for  the  coming  hunt,  he  has  neither
 touched  nor  nor  looked  directly  at  his  wife  for  three  days.  His  friend
 confirms  that,  for  his  part,  he  has  eaten  no  meat  or  salt  for  the  same  period.


The  the  far  corner  of  the  room,  her  eyes  closed,  sits  the  ancient  shaman.  She
 clutches  her  medicine  pouch  in  one  hand  and  a  cooking  basket  in  the  other.
 The  other  occupants  of  the  sweathouse  keep  a  respectful  distance  from  her.


You  see  an  opening  that  leads  to  the  Coyote's  den.  Type  COYOTE  to  get  there.

The  smoke  around  you  dissipates  as  you  are  transported  from  the   Sweathouse  to

Coyote's  Den
Water  covers  the  earth  as  far  as  the  eyes  can  see  --  except  for  the  distant
 peak  of  Mount  Diabolo.  From  your  perch  atop  Mount  Tamalpais,  you  look  down
 the  mountainside  toward  the  encroaching  ocean.  You  see  a  furtive  movement
 within  a  manzanita  bush.  Slowly,  cautiously,  a  bedraggled  coyote  emerges.  It
 eyes  you  briefly,  then  begins  to  slink  away.

 So  you've  come  to  me  for  advice?  My  friend,  you  couldn't  have  done  better.
 Brother  Eagle  and  Sister  hummingbird  have  their  own  ideas  about  life,  of
 course.  But  my  wisdom  is  seasoned  by  generations  of  living  on  the  ground,  as
 you  do.  Life  with  dirt  underfoot  is  treacherous,  seeker,  as  you  well  know
 already.  Not  strength  nor  love  will  get  you  your  heart's  desire.  But  cunning
 will.  So  heed  me.

Animals  found  in  the  ``rooms''  will  tell  stories  illustrating  the  culture.
They  are  displayed  in  ``VCR  mode'',  e.g.   displayed  paragaph  by  paragraph
including  breaks  so  that  people  can  read  them  at  a  usual  pace.
Alltogether  the  Ohlone  village  offers  shows  a  nice  example  of  what  can  be
done  with  MOO  technology.   The  simulation  is  probably  not  polished  enough
for  real  use  (on  5/95).   For  example,  entering  the  ``coyote  lesson''  was
not  really  ergonomic:   Reading  the  message  ``Ask  the  shaman  Sharkeen  about
Coyote,  and  she  will  tell  you  the  room  that  holds  the  Coyote's  tooth...''
in  the  sweathouse  does  not  really  tell  the  user  that  he  has  to  type  ``say
coyote''  in  order  to  cross  the  exit  to  ``Coyote's  den''.

Within  the  framework  of  ``Teaching  the  Religion  and  Methodology  of  C.G.
Jung'',  Patrick  Jermann6  uses  a  psycho-social  setup7  to  improve  learning.



4.2.4     The  MOO  as  Learning  Environment:   The  case  of  EON

This  section  is  largely  based  on  course-assignment  work  of  two  TECFA  STAF
students:   Virtual  Education  Environment:the  case  of  EON8  by  Eric  Berthoud9
and  Analyse  d'une  activite epdagogique  dans  un  MOO10  by  Patrick  Jermann11
TECFA  has  a  special  relation  to  EON  in  several  ways.   When  D.S.12  decided  to
introduce  MOO-technology  in  our  unit  he  became  interested  in  EONs
constructivist  approach  towards  virtual  educational  environments  and  its
progressive  ``chamber  system''.   Furthermore,  TECFA  was  very  lucky  to  able
to  recruit  xymox13  as  its  first  ``wizard''.   14
The  goals  of  the  EON  Virtual  Educational  Environment15  can  be  found  by
typing  'help  goals'  in  the  EON  MOO16 :


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


>help  goals
1.   Create  an  environment  where  students  can  learn  and  receive  college
credit  through  self  paced  study.   Such  an  environment:
      a.   Is  social,  supporting  collaborative  learning  (e.g.,  synchronous
           communication)
      b.   Teaches  learners  how  to  use  it  without  requiring  separate  "manuals"
           or  "instructions"  external  to  the  environment.
      c.   Allows  learners  to  prepare  and  share  cognitive  maps  of  what  they've
           learned.
      d.   Is  not  a  closed  system.   That  is,  provides  collaborative  access
           to  all  Internet  resources  within  the  environment  itself.
      e.   Is  as  schema-friendly  as  possible.   That  is,  the  methods  of
           interaction  seem  familiar  to  the  learner.
      f.   Supports  a  variety  of  interface  technology:  vt100  (e.g.,  lynx),
           gui  (e.g.,  mosaic)  and  potentially  interface  virtual  reality
      g.   Allows  for  extension  of  the  environment.   That  is,  learners  may
           democratically  add  to  and  modify  Internet  resources.
      h.   Makes  learning  fun.

exploratory  project.   This  spontaneous  enthusiasm  for  cooperation  is  also
characteristic  of  many  other  persons  in  the  ``MOO''  space.   Without  his

in  the  first  place.

For  information  on  the  theoretical  basis  (constructivism)  for  Eon,  type:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


This  clearly  indicates  a  tendency  also  observed  in  some  educational
technology  to  move  away  from  producing  ``teaching  systems''  towards
producing  ``learning  environments''  centered  on  exploration  and  ``active
doing''.


Learning  by  Immersion  at  EON

Most  ``Immersion-based''  learning  at  EON  is  related  to  the  MOO  itself
(learning  how  ``to  MOO'')  and  to  MOO  programming.


           The  new  player,  called  learner  in  EON  (this  goes  with  the
       ideology  of  EON:  everybody  connected  on  EON  is  a  learner),  is
       placed  in  a  tutorial  environment  (Chamber  1).   The  first  virtual
       room  the  learner  is  entering  in  is  a  metal  cube.   (Answer  will
       come  to  know  whether  in  the  conception  of  EON,  that  room  was  so
       designed  in  order  to  figurate  the  box  of  knowledge,  see:   2001
       Space  Odyssey  directed  by  Stanley  Kubrick).
           The  learner  has  to  find  his  way,  moving,  looking  at  signs  and
       notes  and  interpreting  them  correctly  in  order  to  find  oneself  in
       the  "Science  Compounds"  of  EON.  Wise,  the  learner  will  move  to
       "Information  Center"  and  gain  some  information:   an  index  of  basic
       commands  (newbie  help)  as  well  as  the  set  of  goals  of  EON.
       Information  is  also  provided  on  the  fact  that  there  is  a  hierarchy
       among  EON's  learners.   Learners  carry  badges:   red  is  for  guests,
       yellow  is  for  registered  learners,  green  is  for  programmers.
           In  order  to  receive  a  "official  character"  on  EON,  the  player
       must  register.   If  a  learner  can  obtain  this  character,  it  is
       assumed  that  the  learner  knows  "the  rudimentary  commands  for
       moving  around"  EON,  as  stated  in  a  description  of  chamber  one17


           Once  an  official  character,  the  learner  wishes  to  know  more
       about  EON.  Passing  through  to  chamber  2  is  allowed.   That  is  where
       the  learner  will  find  parts  of  a  city  with  streets,  buildings  and
       so  on.
           Here  the  learner  will  learn  more  ways  to  move  about  and  to
       communicate.   Opportunity  will  be  given  to  meet  other  learners,  to
       find  the  "Green  Badge  Distribution  Cubicle"  and  to  be  made  a
       programmer.   An  example  of  this  ceremony  is  available  here18
           Many  other  rooms  are  built  in  Chamber  two.   Let  me  mention  a
       hotel,  where  a  room  can  be  made  available,  shops,  bars,  etc.   But
       the  most  important  site  of  chamber  two  is  evidently  the  Convention
       Centre  .   There,  the  learner  finds  a  room  where  the  "Unix  people"
       meet,  usually,  most  of  the  wizards  spend  some  of  their  time  on  EON
       there.   <P>  Just  next  door  is  the  Internet  room  allowing  for
       tutorial,  grading  and  Internet  connections.   Adjacent  are  located
       the  Internet  Exploratorium  -leading  to  a  room  meant  to  allow
       connection  to  the  WEB  and  Gopher-  as  well  as  The  Reporting  Room.

           A  learner  going  into  the  Reporting  Room  will  be  expected  to  use
       it  to  report  of  the  experiences  gained  using  Internet  and  to  ask
       for  grading  on  the  report.   This  room  has  mainly  been  built  as  a
       check  point  for  the  Internet  classes  of  Greg  Swan.
           Linked  to  the  Convention  Center  Corridor,  the  InterVVE
       Communication  room  offers  a  mean  to  see  who  is  connected  to  EON
       via  others  VEE  like  BayMOO,  DU,   TECFAMOO  ,  etc.
           [...]
           Once  entitled  to  a  green  badge,  a  learner  may  venture  to  others
       parts  of  the  world  (EON's).

4.3    Private  Immersion  in  the  MOO


Most  regular  MOO  users  are  strongly  involved  with  those  virtual  worlds.
Education  can  take  benefit  from  that  phenomenon.   As  states
[ACKERMANN,  1994      ,  p.   13],  ``interactivity  is  a  key  to  learning''  and  ``An
increasing  number  of  software  designers,  cognitive  scientists  and  educators
have  come  to  the  view  that  experience  is  actively  constructed  and
reconstructed  through  direct  interaction  with  the  world,  and  that,  indeed,
knowledge  is  experience''.
The  fact  that  users  can  create  their  identities  and/or  habitats  and  share
them  with  others  augments  this  ``heads-in''  effect.   In  a  very  broad  sense
MUDs  are  ``Virtual  Realities''  because  they  form  a  habitat  or  micro-world
in  which  many  users  can  play-out  some  imagined  scenario  onto  a  tangible  and
responsive  support  (see  [ACKERMANN,  1994      ,  p.   13]  again).

Chapter  5



Social  Issues



5.1    On  ruling  a  MUD


Many  forms  of  ``government''  can  be  observed.   Roughly  there  are  several
levels  on  which  users  can  participate  in  various  ways:


  1.   The  ``theme  level''  or  ``purpose  level''  of  the  MOO.


  2.   The  infrastructure  level


          o

          o  The  ``topology  level''  defining  what  can  be  built  and  where

          o  The  ``communications''  and  ``transportation  level''  defining  how
             people  can  interact  and  move


  3.   The  social  level:   What  manners  are  encouraged  or/and  allowed


On  most  MOOs  there  are  several  social  classes  and  institutions  fulfilling
different  functions:
At  the  technical  level  we  can  distinguish:


  1.   The  archwizard  (or  owner)


  2.   The  wizards  (or  janitors)


  3.   The  programmers


  4.   The  builders


  5.   The  players  (or  basic  users)


  6.   The  guests


On  most  MOOs  different  kinds  of  democratic  rights  are  given  to  those
classes  since  they  have  different  technical  ``powers''.   The  most  powerful
figures  are  the  wizards.   On  some  MOOs  they  have  almost  godly  powers,  on
others  they  rather  have  system  (and  accessorily  police)  duties  like  any
system  administrator  on  large  systems.   In  addition,  most  do  a  lot  of
programming  too.

5.2    Manners


Virtually  every  MOO  tries  to  impose  a  minimal  set  of  manners  to  its  users.
First  of  all  respect  of  the  theme  is  important,  not  just  in  research  and
education  MOOs  as  the  following  quote  from  BayMOO  shows:


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


>go  theme
You  step  through  the  opening  into  the  module  named  Theme  of  BayMOO.
Intro  to  BayMOO  [Theme  of  BayMOO:  Theme  :  Overview]
There  are  two  major  themes  that  make  BayMOO  unique  among  the  all-text  virtual
realities  on  the  NET:
          1)  The  Humanities  of  the  San  Francisco  Bay  Area  and
          2)  The  Meanings  of  Water.
   These  are  available  to  all  who  want  to  explore  their  uses,  and  the
janitors  of  BayMOO  urge  you  to  use  them.  But  those  who  feel  called  to
other  frontiers  are  also  welcome  to  help  build  BayMOO.
    BayMOO  has  a  one-word  code  of  ethics:  RESPECT
    As  long  as  characters  respect  each  others'  feelings,  BayMOO  is  a
wide-open  textual  terrain  for  the  imagination.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


The  theme  (and  encouragement  to  respect  it)  is  often  shown  in  the  Welcome
Screen  (see  section  2.1.1).   A  lot  of  MOOs  also  provide  a  'help  manners'
command  or  equivalent.
By  looking  at  several  MOOs  (see:   5.2.1  and  5.2.2)  one  can  kind  find
several  major  topics:


  1.   Politeness

  2.   Use  of  resources

  3.   Respect  for  property


Basically  manners  look  at  lot  like  manners  expected  in  a  real  society.   As
in  the  real  world  different  manners  apply  for  different  contexts.

2.  DON'T  WALK  OFF  WITH  OBJECTS  THAT  DON'T  BELONG  TO  YOU.
           BayMOO  is  based  on  trust.   Put  things  back  where  you
           found  them.
3.  DON'T  SPOOF.   Don't  make  it  appear  that  other  persons  are
           saying  or  doing  something  they  aren't.
4.  ONLY  TELEPORT  YOUR  OWN  THINGS.
5.  DON'T  SPY.
6.  ALWAYS  BE  POLITE.   It  is  always  polite  to  to  ask  permission
           before  entering  someone  else's  home.
7.  NO  WEAPONS.   This  is  an  cooperative  environment.
8.  NO  HARASSMENT.

5.2.2     Examples  from  educational  and  research  MOOs

Some  educational  and  research  MOOs  such  as  Diversity  University  are  more
precise.   It  can  be  asked  whether  such  long  messages  (especially  on  a  small
tty  screen)  are  really  read.   But  then  basic  manners  also  are  addressed  in
some  ways  on  the  welcome  screen.

>help  manners
             Expected  Behavior  and  Manners  for  Diversity  University  MOO
             ==========================================================


This  document  describes  the  guidelines  and  expectations  for  acceptable
behavior  on  Diversity  University  MOO,  as  well  as  some  general
suggestions  for  how  to  interact  with  others  on  the  MOO.   Users  are
expected  to  behave  in  a  reasonable  and  responsible  manner  at  all
times,  as  laid  out  by  this  document,  and  failure  to  do  so  can  result
in  disciplininary  action  by  the  wizards  of  the  MOO.


General  security  issues  and  matters  which  involve  the  functional
integrity  of  the  MOO,  access  to  unauthorized  abilities  or  areas,  or
real-world  legal  concerns  are  not  covered  in  this  document.   For
information  on  these  policies,  please  see  'help  terms'.


Social  Interaction
------------------


The  MOO  is  not  a  game.   It  is  a  real  social  environment  with  people  of
all  ages,  from  all  walks  of  life,  from  all  over  the  globe.   Citizens
of  Diversity  University  are  expected  to  act  accordingly.   This  means
the  following:


1.   Harassment  of  other  users  will  not  be  tolerated.   This  includes,
but  is  not  limited  to,  spamming  (filling  their  screen  with  unwanted
text),  teleporting  them  or  their  objects  without  their  permission,
repeated  paging  or  following  them  after  they  have  expressed  a  desire
to  be  left  alone,  broadcasting  messages  to  everyone  on  the  MOO,  or
actions  done  with  the  specific  intent  of  causing  another  person
annoyance  or  discomfort.


2.   While  freedom  of  speech  is  an  important  part  of  Diversity
University,  obscene  language,  violence,  unwanted  sexual  acts,  or  other
blatantly  offensive  behavior  will  also  not  be  tolerated.


3.   Spoofing  (displaying  text  that  is  not  obviously  attributed  to  your
character)  to  deceive  others  or  avoid  responsibility  for  one's  actions
is  traceable  and  is  not  allowed.   Moreover,  programming  or  making
available  verbs  designed  specifically  to  display  text  without
attribution  or  misattributed  text  is  also  not  allowed.


4.   Spying  on  others  is  expressly  prohibited.   All  objects  which  relay
messages  heard  in  a  room  to  another  person  or  location  must  clearly
state  that  they  do  so.   Silent  teleportation  is  also  a  form  of  spying,
as  is  any  mechanism  intended  to  intercept  messages  not  intended  for
you  through  unanticipated  loopholes  (this  last  is  also  a  security
issue,  see  'help  terms').


5.   Common  courtesy  is  expected  from  all  users  toward  others  on  the
MOO.   In  addition  to  the  above  points,  this  means  paging  others  before
joining  them  in  a  non-public  space  (a  private  room,  a  classroom,  etc),
asking  before  taking  or  using  objects  that  do  not  belong  to  you,

5.2.   MANNERS                                                                                        43



leaving  objects  where  you  find  them,  and  all  of  the  other  courtesies
you  would  follow  when  visiting  someone  else's  house  or  place  of
business.


Users  should  also  attempt  to  respect  other  people's  sensibilities.
Inhabitants  of  Diversity  University  come  from  a  wide  range  of
cultural,  religious,  and  racial  backgrounds  which  should  be
acknowledged  and  respected.   Not  everyone  has  the  same  feelings  of
acceptable  speech  and  behavior,  and  consideration  of  others'  feelings
is  an  essential  part  of  reasonable  behavior  on  Diversity  University.


Diversity  University  is  also  a  family  environment  with  participants  of
all  ages,  and  actions  and  statements  made  in  this  environment  should
reflect  this.   Public  use  of  language  or  actions  which  are  not
suitable  for  children  will  not  be  tolerated  on  this  system.


Should  you  have  problems  with  another  user  who  is  not  following  these
requirements,  please  report  their  actions  to  a  wizard  or  other
designated  authority.   If  none  are  immediately  available,  some
commands  for  temporary  sanctuary  are  available.   For  more  information
see  help  on  @gag,  @refuse,  and  @eject.


For  tips  on  contacting  wizards  and  other  busy  people,  see  'help  wizards'.


Polite  Use  of  MOO  Resources
---------------------------


Be  considerate  when  designing  verbs  and  objects  to  perform  tasks  on
the  MOO.   MOO  resources  are  shared  amongst  all  the  inhabitants,  and
badly  designed  systems  can  affect  the  performance  of  the  entire  MOO.
Do  not  design  code  or  create  systems  that  consume  inordinate  amounts
of  processing  time  or  resources  without  consultation  with  the  wizards
first,  and  always  design  code  in  such  a  way  as  to  be  as  efficient  and
server-friendly  as  possible.


Help  keep  database  size  down.   Use  verbs  such  as  @copy  only  when
absolutely  necessary.   Do  not  copy  nifty  verbs  someone  else  has  made
to  yourself  so  you  can  use  them.   Ask  them  or  a  wizard  to  put  the  verb
on  a  feature  object  instead.   Use  @rmm  to  remove  personal  mail
messages  once  you  are  done  with  them,  and  keep  cross-posting  (sending
the  same  mail  messages  to  multiple  recipients)  to  a  minimum.


When  copying  or  modifying  other  people's  code,  be  sure  to  ask
permission  first,  and  comply  with  any  requests  they  have  regarding  the
use  of  their  code.   Simply  because  something  is  readable  does  not  give
you  the  right  to  use  or  copy  it,  and  use  of  another  person's  code
against  their  wishes  is  both  illegal  and  not  allowed  on  this  MOO.


Another  limited  resource  of  the  MOO  is  player  names.   Player  names  and
aliases,  unlike  the  names  and  aliases  of  other  types  of  objects,  are
required  to  be  unique.   This  means  that  if  you  have  taken  a  certain
name  as  your  name  or  one  of  your  aliases,  nobody  else  can  have  a
character  with  that  name.   For  this  reason,  please  keep  the  number  of
your  aliases,  particularly  common  ones,  to  a  minimum.   Users  should

44                                                                       CHAPTER  5.   SOCIAL  ISSUES



only  have  aliases  that  relate  directly  to  their  character's  name,  and
possibly  one  (reasonable)  nickname.

>help  manners
The  MOO,  like  other  MUDs,  is  a  social  community;  it  is  populated  by  real
 people  that  you  interact  with  via  network  connections.   Like  other
 communities  of  human  beings,  the  members  of  this  one  have  evolved  certain
 guidelines  for  the  behavior  of  the  participants.   This  article  lays  out  what
 the  wizards  believe  to  be  the  general  consensus  concerning  these  `rules  of
 courteous  behavior,'  or  `manners,'  on  the  MOO.


Many  of  the  rules  that  follow  are  by  no  means  `obvious'  or  even  related  to
 similar  rules  in  the  real  world.   The  MOO  is  not  the  real  world;  it  has  its
 own  special  properties  that  require  new  kinds  of  rules.   These  rules  have
 been  worked  out  through  our  experiences  with  the  MOO;  they  reflect  what  we've
 learned  about  what  make  the  MOO  an  enjoyable  place.


           >>  Be  polite.   Avoid  being  rude.  <<
The  MOO  is  worth  participating  in  because  it  is  a  pleasant  place  for  people  to
 be.   When  people  are  rude  or  nasty  to  one  another,  it  stops  being  so  pleasant.


           >>  Turn  the  other  cheek.  <<
If  someone  is  nasty  to  you,  please  either  ignore  it  or  tell  a  janitor  about
 it  if  you  must.   Please  *don't*  try  to  take  revenge  on  the  person;  this  just
 escalates  the  level  of  rudeness  and  makes  the  MOO  a  less  pleasant  place
 for  everyone  involved.


           >>  Respect  other  players'  sensibilities.  <<
The  participants  on  the  MOO  come  from  a  wide  range  of  cultures  and
 backgrounds.   Your  ideas  about  what  constitutes  offensive  speech  or
 descriptions  are  likely  to  differ  from  those  of  other  players.   Please  keep
 the  text  that  players  can  casually  run  across  as  free  of  potentially-offensive
 material  as  you  can.   If  you  want  to  build  objects  or  areas  that  are  likely
 to  offend  some  segment  of  the  community,  please  give  sufficient  warning  to
 the  casual  explorer  so  that  they  can  choose  to  avoid  those  objects  or  areas.


           >>  Don't  spoof.  <<
Spoofing  is  loosely  defined  as  `causing  misleading  output  to  be  printed  to
 other  players.'   For  example,  it  would  be  spoofing  for  anyone  but  Munchkin  to
 print  out  a  message  like  `Munchkin  sticks  out  his  tongue  at  Potrzebie.'   This
 makes  it  look  like  Munchkin  is  unhappy  with  Potrzebie  even  though  that  may
 not  be  the  case  at  all.   Please  be  aware  that,  while  it  is  easy  to  write  MOO
 programs  that  spoof,  it  is  also  easy  to  detect  such  spoofing  and  correctly
 trace  it  to  its  source.   See  `help  spoofing'  for  more  details.


           >>  Don't  shout.  <<
It  is  easy  to  write  a  MOO  command  that  prints  a  message  to  every  connected
 player  in  the  MOO.   Please  don't.   It  is  generally  annoying  to  receive  such
 messages;  such  shouting  should  be  reserved  for  really  important  uses,  like
 wizards  telling  everyone  that  the  server  is  about  to  be  shut  down.

5.2.   MANNERS                                                                                        45



 Non-wizards  never  have  a  good  enough  reason  to  shout.   Use  `page'  instead.


           >>  Only  teleport  your  own  things.  <<
By  default,  most  objects  (including  other  players)  allow  themselves  to  be
 moved  freely  from  place  to  place  within  the  MOO.   This  fact  makes  it  easier
 to  build  useful  objects  like  exits  and  magic  rings  that  move  things  as  a  part
 of  their  normal  role  in  the  virtual  reality.   Unfortunately,  it  also  makes  it
 easy  to  move  other  players  from  place  to  place  without  their  permission,  or
 to  move  objects  in  and  out  of  other  players'  possession.   Please  don't  do
 this;  it's  annoying  (at  the  least)  to  the  poor  victim  and  can  only  cause  bad
 feelings.
EXCEPTION:   Room  owners  should  feel  free  to  eject  unwanted  objects/players
 from  their  own  rooms  or  to  divert  unwanted  objects/players  trying  to  enter
 their  rooms.


           >>  Don't  teleport  silently.  <<
It  is  easy  to  write  MOO  commands  that  move  you  instantly  from  place  to  place.
 In  writing  such  programs,  please  remember  to  print  a  message  to  all  players
 both  in  the  place  you're  moving  from  and  in  the  place  you're  moving  to.   It
 is  disconcerting  and  otherwise  unpleasant  for  someone  to  suddenly  say
 something  in  a  room  without  there  ever  having  been  a  notice  that  that  person
 had  arrived.   Similarly,  it  is  annoying  to  discover  that  you've  been  talking
 for  some  time  to  a  person  who  has  left  the  room  without  a  sound.


           >>  Don't  hog  the  server.  <<
The  server  is  carefully  shared  among  all  of  the  connected  players  so  that
 everyone  gets  a  chance  to  execute  their  commands.   This  sharing  is,  by
 necessity,  somewhat  approximate  however;  while  players  cannot  completely  shut
 out  others,  they  can  significantly  degrade  the  server's  overall  performance.
 The  most  annoying  way  to  do  this  is  to  run  MOO  programs  that  loop  forever  (or
 for  a  long  time)  using  `fork  (0)'  or  `suspend(0)'  occasionally  to  keep  from
 running  out  of  ticks.   If  you  are  writing  a  program  that  will  run  for  a  long
 time,  please  make  it  wait  at  least  five  seconds  between  iterations.   That  is,
 if  your  task  will  run  continuously,  use  `fork  (n)'  or  `suspend(n)'  where  `n'
 is  at  least  five.


           >>  Don't  waste  object  numbers.  <<
Some  people,  in  a  quest  to  own  objects  with  what  they  consider  `interesting'
 object  numbers  (e.g.,  #17000,  #18000,  etc.)  have  written  MOO  programs  that
 simply  loop,  creating  and  recycling  objects  until  the  `good'  numbers  come  up.
   Please  don't  do  this;  it  artificially  inflates  all  object  numbers  and
 increases  the  disk  space  used  by  the  server  unnecessarily.


        >>  Don't  Crack  <<
It  should  go  without  saying:  attempting  to  break  into  the  system  to  obtain
 more  quota,  power,  other  player's  site  information,  etc.  is  *very*  rude.  See
 'help  cracking'  for  more  on  this  topic.


           ==============================


The  wizards  are  always  interested  in  hearing  players'  feedback  on  these  rules
 of  behavior.   The  rules  were  developed  by  the  consensus  of  players  and  can  be
 expected  to  evolve  that  way,  too.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------



5.3    Social  Identities  on  MUDs


5.3.1     Should  "serious"  MOOs  allow  anonymity  ?

At   TECFAMOO  we  probably  will  take  the  option  of  making  available  a  persons
e-mail  address.   This  insures  in  the  owners  opinion  accountability  of  users
acts  and  more  importantly  it  reduces  the  amount  of  monitoring  needed.
A  different  stance  can  be  taken  as  shown  by  a  message  posted  by  Richelieu
on  *MOOteach@DU  (21  and  24,  Jan  14  94):


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


To  tell  the  truth,  I  don't  really  like  the  idea  of  a  student  player
class  at  all  (except  maybe  for  young  students),  and  I  really  don't
like  the  idea  that  teachers  should  have  absolute  control  over  what
their  students  can  and  can't  do  here.   This  place  isn't  just  a
teaching  environment,  it  should  be  a  learning  environment  too,  and  the
more  you  restrict  what  a  student  can  do,  the  less  likely  they  are  to
want  to  learn  what  you're  trying  to  teach  them,  and  the  less  able  they
are  to  learn  anything  else.


This  is  a  brave  new  world,  and  I  find  it  really  distressing  that
people  seem  to  be  falling  back  into  RL  preconceptions  and  ideas  about
control.   Having  lived  in  MOOs  for  a  long  time  now,  I've  found  that
even  the  more  unruly  people  can  usually  be  dealt  with  in  much  more
effectively  if  not  simply  grouped  into  one  big  category  of
"troublemakers"  and  locked  in  shackles.   And  I  also  don't  believe  the
point  of  Diversity  University  should  not  be  to  allow  a  captive
audience  for  someone  because  they  can't  control  their  students  in  RL.


Now,  I  do  believe  that  some  things  are  good  ideas.   There  should  be
the  ability  for  a  teacher  to  make  their  classroom  page-proof,  and
prevent  similar  disruptive  influences  from  outside,  and  to  be  able  to
identify  anyone  they  are  responsible  for  (this  does  not  necessarily
mean  all  their  students.   By  responsibility  I  mean  primarily  all
characters  with  a  group  RL  email  account,  since  registered  email
addresses  are  the  primary  form  of  responsibility  enforceable  by  the
wizards).   It  must  also,  of  course,  be  possible  for  a  teacher  to
ensure  that  they're  dealing  with  who  they  think  they're  dealing  with
when  it  comes  to  grades  and  such.


Beyond  this,  I  am  strongly  in  favor  of  anonymity  for  anyone  who
desires  it  (please  keep  in  mind  that  the  wizards  always  have  access  to
the  information,  and  if  there  are  problems,  they  are  the  ones  who
should  be  handling  it  anyway,  so  irresponsibility  is  not  an  issue
here).   The  ability  to  be  anonymous  often  results  in  people  who  are
more  likely  to  try  new  things,  voice  their  opinions,  ask  questions,
and  generally  experiment,  particularly  in  the  areas  of  social
interaction,  ideological  preconceptions,  psychological  issues,  and
other  things  that  they  wouldn't  necessarily  feel  comfortable  dealing
with  in  a  RL  environment,  and  I  don't  think  that  we  should  be  so
limited  in  our  goals  as  to  ignore  this  as  a  valuable  potential  part  of

5.3.   SOCIAL  IDENTITIES  ON  MUDS                                                              47



D.U.s  environment.   I  speak  from  experience  in  this  respect,  not  only
regarding  others  I  have  known  but  regarding  myself  as  well.


Moreover,  lack  of  anonymity  has  a  significant  effect  on  how  people
perceive  this  virtual  space  that  they're  in.   If  user  information  is
available,  people  inevitably  use  it,  and  this  place  simply  becomes  a
bunch  of  people  with  masks  on,  not  real  at  all.   With  anonymity  comes
a  much  more  real  social  structure  and  a  feeling  that  one  is  part  of
something  that  isn't  simply  a  game  or  a  computer  program  somewhere,
but  a  real  society,  which  often  leads  to  a  very  real  sense  of
belonging  (often,  in  the  case  of  people  who  are  normally
troublemakers,  for  people  who  otherwise  don't  feel  that  they  belong
very  much  of  anywhere),  and  a  feeling  of  social  responsibility  to
_their_  society.


While  it  is  inevitably  true  that  we  will  get  our  share  of
troublemakers  and  problem  people,  this  will,  for  the  most  part,  be
unaffected  by  whether  people  are  anonymous  or  not,  and  the  treatment
of  real  problem  people  will  not  be  significantly  improved  by  lack  of
anonymity  anyway.   I  strongly  believe  that  the  ability  of  the
individual  to  choose  can  not  only  significantly  improve  the  academic
atmosphere,  but  can  lead  to  a  better  understanding  of  this  new
environment,  and  a  much  more  mature  attitude  towards  the  MOO  and  the
people  in  it.


[...]


[...]  my  point  comes  down  to  this:  I  have  been  in  places  that  have
complete  anonymity  and  places  that  have  very  little.   I  have  found
almost  exclusively  that  the  places  with  anonymity  are  more
interesting,  have  more  discussion  on  a  wider  range  of  issues,  and  have
a  wider  range  of  people  and  experiences  available.   It  is  my  belief
that  this  is  the  type  of  place  that  Diversity  University  should  be,
and  it  is  my  belief  that  a  lack  of  anonymity  is  an  unnecessary  measure
that  would  only  serve  to  hinder  this.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


In  some  cases  anonymity  has  clear  advantages.   Like  ceejay  notes  on
*MOOteach@DU  (27,  Jan  14  94)  there  are  cases  where  anonymity  is  necessary
or  an  advantage:


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


[...]
an  example  might  be  a  group  of  students  for  a  class  on  human  sexuality.   in
an  ideal  society  i  should  be  able  to  walk  into  this  class  and  say  that  i
am  bisexual  without  having  to  worry  about  the  other  students.   however,
i  have  been  in  classes  where  i  was  told  that  bisexuals  were  untrustworthy.
i  could  not  reveal  my  sexuality  in  this  class  without  having  my  opinions
of  everything  else  colored  by  it.


another  argument  for  anonymity  would  be  so  that  another  student  is  not
prejudiced  by  what  obvious  characteristics  make  up  who  i  am.   for  example

48                                                                      CHAPTER  5.     SOCIAL  ISSUES



on  a  mud  i  can  play  a  male  or  female  character,  or  a  character  with  no
gender  that  corresponds  to  genders  in  real  life.   like  it  or  not,  there
is  a  great  deal  of  stereotyping  by  gender  in  life.   my  field  experience
instructor  appears  to  believe  that  females  decide  to  stop  liking  math
in  junior  high  because  they  (the  students)  don't  think  it  will  make
them  appear  feminine  enough.   in  my  women's  studies  class,  it  was
believed  that  men  could  not  discuss  the  topic  because  they  just  couldn't
understand.

5.4    wizards


[under  construction]
Wizards  are  the  organizational  backbone  of  a  MOO,  as  it  is  shown  also  in
the  discussion  in  section  5.1.   We  would  like  to  address  several  questions
here:

    o  The  Wizard  culture

    o  Owners  and  Wizards

    o  Programming  vs.   Ruling  vs.   Administrating


5.4.1     A  story  from  the  MOO  Cows

In  May  95  a  kid  posted  the  following  message  to  the  MOO-Cows  mailing  list:



Hi  my  name  is  Bryan  Snyder  and  i  would  like  to  apply  to  be  a  wizard  on  any
MOO  that  is  in  need.Please  write  back  at  bjs1os@wizard.stark.k12.oh.us.  I'm
an  experienced  at  programming  $features  and  $things.
                                                                                   Thanks,
                                                                                   Bryan  Snyder



This  question  led  to  an  interesting  exchange  on  this  list  revealing  a  lot
on  the  ``wizard  culture''.   Appearently  the  kid  who  posted  the  message  is  a
``real''  7th  grader,  very  enthousiastic  about  computers  and  MOOing,  but
quite  unaware  of  what  it  takes  to  be  a  ``real  wizard''.   In  the  first  place
he  mostly  got  friendly,  but  ironic  remarks.   Taking  them  badly  he  reposted
short  and  socially  inappropriate  messages  also  badly  lacking  grammar.   This
lead  to  increasingly  nasty  messages  by  others  but  also  to  some  who  thought
one  should  give  the  kid  a  break  and  more  who  reiterated  friendly  advice  on
how  to  become  a  ``real  wizard''.
Anyhow  the  interesting  thing  was  not  the  evolution  of  this  particular
exchange,  but  some  of  detailed  remarks  he  got  back  from  real  wizards
showing  their  understanding  of  their  role  and  the  of  the  path(es)  leading
to  wizard  function.   In  the  following  section  we  refer  to  this  material  as
``Brian's  request  to  be  a  wiz''.
