We could observe several models for the welcome area:
<OL><LI> Most educational MOOs have people land in area which gives access
to a lot of information. Sometimes (as in Collegetown shown in figure
<A HREF="node16.html#figWelcomeAreaCollege">3.1</A>) this area is also a central room of the
MOO.<LI> Culture and leisure MOOs more often tend to let people arrive
in a ``closet'' or other room devoid of interest. A visitors is center
is sometimes adjacent sometimes not and it has to be found.<LI> Others like Diversity University MOO and more so EON have a ``stage''
approach.

Let's now have a closer look a Diversity University MOO (DUM). DUM is
interesting because of its size and solutions found there may be of
general interest.
At DUM one lands first in a general welcome room which
has been rather designed to keep certain behavior or people from this
MOO.

                ***** DIVERSITY UNIVERSITY IS NOT A GAME *****

It is a place where many people from various backgrounds come to do work and
interact in a mature and responsible environment, and as a visitor you are
expected to behave in an appropriate manner.

   Swearing, offensive language, obscenity, harassment, and rudeness will
   not be tolerated here.  If you must do that, do it somewhere else.

 If you're not sure if something is ok or not, ASK FIRST.  If someone asks
 you to stop doing something they find objectionable, STOP.  For a more
 complete list of what behavior is and is not considered appropriate here,
 type 'help manners' once connected.

NOTE:  You can and will be booted off the system and barred further access to
       this MOO if you cannot behave responsibly.  Under some circumstances
       your actions on this system can be logged or monitored as well. Your
       connection site is being displayed in your description; anyone can
       see where you are connected from.

If you do not wish to agree to these conditions, type @quit to leave the MOO.
[Press return to continue or type '@quit' to disconnect]
