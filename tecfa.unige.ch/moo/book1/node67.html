In May 95 a kid posted the following message to the MOO-Cows mailing
list:
<P>
<PRE>Hi my name is Bryan Snyder and i would like to apply to be a wizard on any
MOO that is in need.Please write back at bjs1os@wizard.stark.k12.oh.us. I'm
an experienced at programming $features and $things.
                                                         Thanks,
                                                         Bryan Snyder</PRE>
<P>
This question led to an interesting exchange on this list revealing
a lot on the ``wizard culture''. Appearently the kid who posted
the message is a ``real'' 7th grader, very enthousiastic about computers
and MOOing, but quite unaware of what it takes to be a ``real wizard''.
In the first place he mostly got friendly, but ironic remarks.
Taking them badly he reposted short and socially inappropriate
messages also badly lacking grammar. This lead to increasingly nasty
messages by others but also to some who thought one should give
the kid a break and more who reiterated friendly advice on how to
become a ``real wizard''.
<P>
Anyhow the interesting thing was not the evolution of this
particular exchange,
but some of detailed remarks he got back from real wizards showing
their understanding of their role and the of the path(es) leading to
wizard function.
In the following section we refer to this material as
``Brian's request to be a wiz''.
