Educational activities on MOOs can be broadly distinguished among those who:
<UL><LI> try to replicate traditional class-room setups<LI> tend to use the MOO for new ways of teaching and learning (and
therefore get away from the ``class-room'' metaphor
</UL>
<P>
However, one can ask the question how virtual classrooms are different
from real ones and how they could exploit extra-potential from the
MOOs.  This latter question is very important since virtual ``MOO''
classrooms clearly have disadvantages.
<P>
Now several advantages of the virtual class room could be cited, like
the following ones:
<P>
(1) Virtual Classrooms in a MOO allow for ``layered communication''
over different channels. This allows for instance students to discuss
among themselves without disturbing the class or to isolate
tutor-one student interactions which are not of general interest.
More sophisticated classrooms can be furnished with ``tables''
suited for group-work (a setup that can be found often in real
primary school).
<P>
(2) Provided that a good Mud client is available to the student,
class-room teaching (an specially lecturing) looses some of its
not always desired linearity. At anytime a student can scroll back
and (provided he can split the screen) still monitor what is going
on.
<P>
(3) Along the same lines, a virtual class-room has a ``memory''.
Teachers do not have to repeat things as frequently and at the
same time things said before can be pasted back into the discussion.
<P>
(4) Students may have better access to ``external sources'' such
as other tutors, on-line books and so during a class.
<P>
Of course there is a limit to all that. It is well known that
human processing power is very limited for structured cognitive
tasks. We can do only a small amount of things at the same time.
So MOO teachers whish to exploit those and other extra-functionalities
they will have to take into account those limits and ``slow down'',
but make sure that students don't get bored or involved into
other activities at the same time.
<P>
In any case, in most situations it is probably best to avoid using
the MOO for lecturing (that can be done by providing a text over
the WWW) and use those classrooms for more interactive tutoring instead.
<P>
Interested readers may want to look at those transcripts
from a MOO-programming lesson 
[retrieve the thing from colin], read Henstell's
