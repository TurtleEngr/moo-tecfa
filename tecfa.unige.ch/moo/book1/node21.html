There are a few basic rules for building in the <B>TECFA</B><TT>MOO</TT> which
builders should follow:
<P>
<OL><LI> The topology of Geneva has to be vaguely respected.<LI> Certain types of activities should be restricted to certain
  areas.  The major focus of this MOO is exchange in educational
  technology, education and research. However other activities are
  welcome too.<LI> All major education and research activities should take place in
  the virtual &quot;Geneva Basin&quot; (see the next page). They will be
  connected with a room (currently the &quot;underground corridor&quot;) or
  a similar ``direct access'' artifact.<LI> Strange stuff can be added, but preferrably &quot;outside&quot; of Geneva.
  An airport, a trainstation and such will be provided.
</OL>
<P>
Education and Research Activities in the <B>TECFA</B><TT>MOO</TT> are centered around
a few areas. Currently, there are several sites planned for such
activities:
<P>
<UL><LI> 
  People form the U of Geneva (including TECFA) should use the
  locations of their real buildings (although they may be enhanced).<LI> All teaching on MOO using/building/programming etc. should go to the
  MOOseum area.<LI> Educational Technology, i.e. our domain&quot;, is in and behind TECFA.
  see the EduTech exit in the underground corridor<LI> The Forest Campus. Meet Dave_E for more information!<LI> Space for an International Virtual University is provided at IVC (in
  Archamps, a place over the border in France). You can build as you
  like (maybe we should fix a few rules for that place).<LI> Other stuff can be negotiated of course.
