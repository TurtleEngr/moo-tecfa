MOOs as virtual meeting spaces for professional communities are
becoming increasingly popular.
Well known examples are the
<A NAME="tex2html27" HREF="telnet://purple-crayon.media.mit.edu:8888/">MediaMOO</A>
(Media Researchers),
<A NAME="tex2html28" HREF="telnet://brando.ipac.caltech.edu:8888/">AstroMOO</A>
(Astronomers),
<A NAME="tex2html29" HREF="http://bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il:8000/">BioMOO</A>
(Biologists)
and

(Post Modern Culture).
<P>
Let's have a look at the purpose of MediaMOO (obtained by typing ``help purpose''):
<PRE>-------------------------------------------------------------- Media MOO 4/95

&gt;help purpose

MediaMOO is a professional community for media researchers.  It is a place to
come meet colleagues in media studies and related fields and brainstorm, to
hold colloquia and conferences, to explore the serious side of this new
medium.

Unlike other MUDs, characters on MediaMOO are identified.  You can find out
who anyone is with the @whois command (except for a few early members who are
still anonymous) so that you can contact them to continue professional
discussions.

To become a member of MediaMOO you must be doing media research.  We are more
interested in knowing about what you are doing than what you are interested
in. Most college and pre-college students who apply are not really doing media
research.

If you're looking for a place to hang out with interesting people, LambdaMOO
is at lambda.parc.xerox.com 8888.  In fact, if you read the USENET newsgroup
rec.games.mud.announce, you'll find a list of hundreds of MUDs and MOOs,
almost all of which have no requirements for membership.

A note to teachers:
Unfortunately, we must discourage you from bringing classes of students here.
Although these experiments are interesting, this is not the appropriate place.
MediaMOO would become a very different place if it were filled with, for
example, hundreds of freshman composition students.

Welcome!

Sincerely,

Amy Bruckman

<P>
This message written in 1993 clearly tries to emphasize distinction between
a place dedicated to one specific task (being a place for a community)
and multi-purpose MOOs such as <B>TECFA</B><TT>MOO</TT>.
<P>
BioMOO shows a similar statement, but is also used for educational
purposes.

BioMOO is a virtual meeting place for biologists, connected to the Globe-wide
Network Academy. The main physical part of the BioMOO is located at the
Bioinformatics Unit of the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel.

BioMOO is a professional community of Biology researchers.  It is a
place to come meet colleagues in Biology studies and related fields and
brainstorm, to hold colloquia and conferences, to explore the serious
side of this new medium.

All characters on BioMOO are identified.  You can find out who anyone is
by using the @whois command, so that you can contact them to continue
professional discussions.

BioMOO is continuously growing and changing. Your ideas for new additions
and modifications are welcome. Please contact Gustavo by email to
Gustavo@bioinformatics.weizmann.ac.il

If you're looking for a place to hang out with interesting people,
LambdaMOO is at lambda.parc.xerox.com 8888.  In fact, if you read the
USENET newsgroup rec.games.mud.announce, you'll find a list of hundreds
of MUDs and MOOs, almost all of which have no requirements for
membership.
