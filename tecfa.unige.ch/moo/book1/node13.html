Traditional software engineering can be characterized by the idea that
things can be planned and designed in advance and then implemented
according to detailed specifications. Clearly, most MOOs are not
built up this way. They are never finished. However, the questions of
(1) what has to be there before users are invited to join and
of (2) what can be done to insure and master growth and change have to
be asked in an early stage.
The danger in MOO mangement is that the MOO wizards and other important
``players'' view the MOO from their perspective. In fact, the complexity
of the MOO is rather a result of all users perspectives (or more 
precisely of what they do (build, interact, etc.) in the MOO.
<P>
Central planning can be done in similar ways as it is done in large
social bodies. Note however, that the phenomenology of a MOO world
is rather open (topology, means of navigation and communication, etc.)
Elements needed are:
<P>
<UL><LI> Rules that define a purpose of the system: The theme of the MOO
should be defined in a way that target users feel attracted to the MOO
but also in a way that is open for evolution.<LI> Rules that govern social interactions (including rules about changing
those rules): See chapter <A HREF="node51.html#chasocial">9</A> for more.<LI> A basic topology and rules for extending it.<LI> Rules that define the phenomenological properties of the world.
</UL>
<P>
This list clearly shows that planning is as much concerned with
social issues (the MOO is a living thing) as with building and
adding code. A larger quotation from Lucasfilm habitat corroborates
this opinion:
<BLOCKQUOTE> ``Again and again we found that activities based on often unconscious 
assumptions about player behavior had completely unexpected outcomes 
(when they were not simply outright failures).  It was clear that we 
were not in control.  The more people we involved in something, the 
less in control we were.  We could influence things, we could set up 
interesting situations, we could provide opportunities for things to 
happen, but we could not dictate the outcome.  Social engineering is, 
at best, an inexact science (or, as some wag once said, <EM>in the most 
carefully constructed experiment under the most carefully controlled 
conditions, the organism will do whatever it damn well pleases</EM>).
<P>
Propelled by these experiences, we shifted into a style of operations 
in which we let the players themselves drive the direction of the 
design.  This proved far more effective.  Instead of trying to push 
the community in the direction we thought it should go, an exercise 
rather like herding mice, we tried to observe what people were doing 
and aid them in it.  We became facilitators as much as we were 
designers and implementors.  This often meant adding new features and 
new regions to the system at a frantic pace, but almost all of what 
we added was used and appreciated, since it was well matched to 
people's needs and desires.  We, as the experts on how the system 
worked, could often suggest new activities for people to try or ways 
of doing things that people might not have thought of.  In this way 
we were able to have considerable influence on the system's 
development in spite of the fact that we didn't really hold the 
steering wheel &amp; more influence, in fact, than we had had when we 
were operating under the illusion that we controlled everything.
<P>
Indeed, the challenges posed by large systems are prompting some 
researchers to question the centralized, planning dominated attitude 
that we have criticized here, and to propose alternative approaches 
based on evolutionary and market principles [16-18].  These 
principles appear applicable to complex systems of all types, not 
merely those involving interacting human beings.''

In a more recent paper ([<A HREF="node68.html#FARMER94">Farmer et&nbsp;al., 1994</A>, lines 296ff.,]) the authors
of habitat emphasize
the need of planning for change again:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> ``Communities must be able to grow and transform.  
Many emerging electronic communities die for lack of the 
ability to adapt to change.  Just as companies and small 
organizations go through serious growth pains and often 
disintegrate when they can't adapt, so too have early 
Cyberspace colonies.  This type of adapt-or-die transfor-
mation occurs eventually in every growing virtual com-
munity we've experienced.  A successful system will plan 
for it.  Plan for growth.  Plan for change.  Sense of place 
is critical to the growth of community, as people adopt 
the emerging culture as part of their own.''

Anyhow, despite the fact that most of the planning should be rather
spent on ``how to meet user's needs'' in accordance to the theme, a
few things (both MOO objects and related rules) are essential in early
stages, like:
<P>
<OL><LI> Handling of First Time Users and Beginners<LI> A basic definition of the topology of the MOO: a minimal set of
  rooms defining a world (i.e. a city, a campus or whatever to start
  with) and at least minimal rules on how to add to that.<LI> A few rules on what kind of navigation and communication means
  are appropriate.<LI> At least in ``serious'' MOOs, aids for finding appropriate rooms
  and activities should be provided. Let's cite the Points of
  Interests at DU or BioMOOs ``applications'' in the WWW interface.
