</PRE><DT><A NAME="484">...Habitat</A><DD>
``Lucasfilm's Habitat project was arguably one of the first attempts to 
create a very large scale commercial multi-user virtual environment.  
A far cry from many laboratory research efforts based on 
sophisticated interface hardware and tens of thousands of dollars per 
user of dedicated compute power, Habitat is built on top of an 
ordinary commercial online service and uses an inexpensive &amp; some 
would say toy &amp; home computer to support user interaction.  In 
spite of these somewhat plebeian underpinnings, Habitat is ambitious 
in its scope.  The system we developed can support a population of 
thousands of users in a single shared cyberspace.  Habitat presents 
its users with a real-time animated view into an online simulated 
world in which users can communicate, play games, go on adventures, 
fall in love, get married, get divorced, start businesses, found 
religions, wage wars, protest against them, and experiment with self-
government.'' ([<A HREF="node68.html#MORNINGSTAR90">Morningstar et Farmer, 1990</A>]). Note that the front end home computers used
were Commodore C64 models.
<P>
``Habitat is a graphical many-user virtual online environment, a make-believe world that people enter using 
home computers connected via telephones and packet nets 
to a centralized host running on a commercial online information service.  It was originally available under the 
name Club Caribe through the Commodore 64-only 
QuantumLink service.  It is currently thriving in Japan as 
Fujitsu Habitat on the NIFtyServe service.  Efforts are 
underway to port the Fujitsu version of Habitat to 
America on PCs and Macs for Christmas of 1994.''

  He spontaneously agreed participating in an informal international
  exploratory project. This spontaneous enthusiasm for cooperation
is also characteristic of many other persons in the ``MOO'' space. Without
his initial help, our project maybe would never have ``gotten of the ground''
in the first place.

</PRE><DT><A NAME="485">...``non-constructivist''</A><DD>``The class of problems which interests me here relates to how we think 
about the nature of the electronic community itself.  Two schools of 
thought contend for dominance in this area.
<P>
The first maintains that computer networks are simply extensions of 
existing institutions (e.g., the press) and therefor subject to the same 
constitutional protections and moral and ethical principles that govern 
traditional media.  I believe this is the position taken, for example, 
by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  Oddly, this position can 
accurately be called both liberal and conservative.  It is liberal in 
the sense that the principles that its proponents wish to apply in the 
electronic realm are liberal principles.  It is conservative in the 
sense that it draws on tradition for its sense of direction and denies 
that new technology invalidates fundamental ethical standards.  However, 
both labels already carry so many emotional and ideological associations 
in most people's minds that I hesitate to use either of them.
<P>
The second school of thought maintains that these new technologies are 
different in kind from anything that has come before and therefor that 
the old rules do not apply.  Instead, they maintain, a new set of rules 
must be drafted, based on the unique characteristics of the electronic 
medium.  Notable support for this school comes from two groups that in 
most other respects are antithetical to each other.  The first group 
consists of the utopians and revolutionaries who wish to create in the 
electronic realm a new (and presumably better) world, entirely free of 
the mistakes and problems of the present one.  I met a number of these 
people last year at the First International Conference on Cyberspace.  
The second group includes certain authoritarian establishment members 
who view existing constraints on their powers (e.g., constitutional 
limitations on state authority) as annoying restrictions that merely 
hinder them in attaining what they believe to be worthy goals.  The 
latter group would like to see these constraints confined to as limited 
a sphere as possible; consequently, they readily adopt the position that 
electronic media are &quot;different&quot; and therefor not subject to existing 
protections.  One might include in the latter group a number of the law 
enforcement officials whose actions last year incited the formation of 
the EFF.  Both of these groups really subscribe to the same belief, 
namely that the electronic realm represents an opportunity to fashion an 
order whose form they can design and control.  Adopting a term from F. 
A. Hayek, I will refer to this position as &quot;constructivism&quot;, the belief 
that one can construct a society according to a definite plan.  I 
suppose then that I can call the first position I outlined, the both-
liberal-and-conservative-position-with-no-good-label, &quot;non-constructivist.&quot;
