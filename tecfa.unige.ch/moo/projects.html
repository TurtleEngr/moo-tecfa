We started the TecfaMOO around November 1994. At that time it wasn't
a real project, but something like "let's have MOO and see what we can do".
A few ideas have come up since then, i.e. see the
<A HREF="questions.html">short information on TecfaMOO</A> (including a list research questions). Some of those ideas have turned into more
serious projects or at least "usages".

(Documentation, Teaching, and Technology Transfer)

<H3>Documentation on MOOs and MOOing</H3>

Documentation on MOOs and MOOing is sometimes hard find and certain things
are missing. Therefore we decided to spend some effort on that.

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="book1/tm.html">The evolving TecfaMOO book - part I</A>
This is an unfinished attempt to build a conceptual MOO resource book.

<LI><A HREF="http://tecfa.unige.ch/moo/book2/tm2.html">The evolving TecfaMOO book - part II</A>
This is an ongoing attempt to build a MOO builder's and programmer's
manual.

<LI>Also, we decided to created educational MUD/text-base VR resource pages
and host other information useful for the community.
See <A HREF="moocommunity.html">the MOO Comunity page for details</A>.

<H3>MOO Education at TECFA</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Our Diploma Students are introduced to text-based VR (MOOs) in 2 courses:
<A HREF="http://tecfa.unige.ch/tecfa/teaching/staf14/staf14-overview.html">Staf14 </A>
(Introduction to CMC and information systems) and
<A HREF="http://tecfa.unige.ch/tecfa/teaching/staf18-overview.html/">staf-18</A>
(introduction to virtual environments)
See the <A HREF="education.html">MOO Education at Tecfa</A> page
for details.

<li>Since Fall 96, introduction to programming is taught with the MOO
(see <A HREF="http://tecfa.unige.ch/tecfa/teaching/staf14/staf14-overview.html">Staf14</A>
and the tutorial section in the <A HREF="http://tecfa.unige.ch/moo/book2/tm2.html">TecfaMOO Manuel</A>

<LI><A HREF="stu_projects.html">TecfaMOO Student Projects</A>:
Some student work is associated with bigger research
projects (e.g. bootnap). Also some are using the MOO for a
 master thesis or a practical work
requirement (stage). [information on those will appear sometimes]
 <P>
Documentation developed for our courses may be of use to others:
See the <A HREF="builders.html">Builder's and Programmer's Information</A>page.

<H3>Technology Transfert: Increase the popularity of MOOs</H3>

E.g. "Easy" publications and conferences, as well as organization of workshops,
mentening the MOO in publications about distance edcuations, ...

<H2><A NAME="xtocid11313">4. MOO as CMC Tool for teaching and cooperation</A></H2>
<UL>
<LI>TecfaMOO is increasingly used as non-intrusive
CMC tool for internal communication
<LI>Since our <a href="http://tecfa.unige.ch/tecfa/tecfa-teaching/teaching-overview.html#postgrad">postgraduate "STAF"</a>diploma in educational technology is organized as
"semi-distance curriculum", the MOO is being also increasingly used to
communicate with our students at remote sites.
<LI>We are hosting virtual sessions of researchers (e.g. people from
<A HREF="http://tecfa.unige.ch/tecfa/tecfa-research/lhm/lhm-overview.html">the ESF/LHM programme</A>).
See the
<A HREF="VMDL/VMDL-1.html">The VDML/MOO report</A> for more details or
<A HREF="paris96/papers/daniel.html">"Virtual Environments for Education, Research and Life"</A> a position paper.

<LI>The <A HREF="http://tecfa.unige.ch/pangea/">international Pangea</A> project brings together kids from 3 continents.
A short <A HREF="http://tecfa.unige.ch/tecfa/research/pnr33/french/pnrweb-63.html">text in french</A> is available as well as
un <A HREF="http://tecfa.unige.ch/~tognotti/staf2x/rapport_plan.html">"rapport de stage</A>.

Some of these uses of TecfaMOO might be turned into research projects.
