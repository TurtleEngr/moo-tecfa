		<h1><a name="top"></a>enCore Change Log</h1>
		<div align="left">
			<h3>June 18, 2000. enCore 2.1.1</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a missing character substitution in $xpress_navigator:menu_html. Thanks to William Painter for pointing out this problem.
				<li>Fixed an issue with $xpress_client:check_moo_mail that broke login for players.
				<li>To prevent future issues with the above I made $frand_class the default $player_class and rewrote $administration_module:view_html so that all new player objects made with Xpress will be based on $frand_class by default. Thanks to Roy Kennedy and others on the enCore-list for bringing this issue to our attention.
			</ul>
			<h3>June 9, 2000. enCore version 2.1</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Removed $web_slate. This object is no longer being supported by its developer and does no longer work.
				<li>Modified the locking system so that it works properly with Xpress. This required modifications to several _html verbs.
				<li>Modified the generic classroom so that objects such as recorders placed on tables pick up conversation.
				<li>Added new command @hide that allows players not to be listed in the who listing if they wish. Modification to $player:@who required.
				<li>Fixed a problem with $guest:do_reset that caused guest accounts not to be properly reset.
				<li>Added a fix to #0:&quot;do_out_of_band_command&quot; so MacMOOSE and tkMOO works properly with enCore. Thanks to Stephen Ashley for contributing this fix.
				<li>Modified $xpress_navigator:menu_html to add button for the VASE system.
				<li>Added Jason Nolan's Virtual Assignment Server Environment (VASE). This system consists of three new core objects, $assignment_server, $assignment, and $assignment_help. For more info see http://achieve.forestry.utoronto.ca/vase/. Thanks to Jason Nolan and Matthew Beerman for contributing the VASE system to the enCore project.
			</ul>
			<h3>April 1, 2000. enCore version 2.0.6</h3>
			<p>This patch addresses certain compatibility issues with Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 for Macintosh which was released on 03/26/00. The fixes in this patch makes Xpress work with this browser. There are, however, a few outstanding issues. See below.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a bug in $Xpress_Navigator:MOO_log that I overlooked in the last patch.
				<li>Fixed an MSIE 5.0 Mac compatibility issue in $xpress_moo_mailer:compose.
				<li>For some strange reason MSIE 5.0 Mac displays Applet ALT tags. Had to modify the Javascript in $xpress_client.javascript_functions, as well as $mootcan:standalone_html to prevent the browser from erroneously showing a message saying that Java must be enabled.
				<li>Removed reference to Netscape Live Audio plug-in in $player:quick_edit.
				<li>Updated the Xpress FAQ with information about MSIE 5.0 Mac.
			</ul>
			<p>Outstanding issues with MSIE 5.0 Mac</p>
			<ul>
				<li>MSIE 5 uses the default sans-serif font to override page specified fonts in all forms. This means that in the default setup, ASCII drawings look skewed in the Xpress Editors. I have never encountered this problem in any other browser. Workaround: Use a monospace font such as Courier as default sans-serif font.
				<li>Save to disk in the Notebook and Log applications is broken. MSIE 5 Mac uses a download manager to fetch files and documents. So far I have not been able to find a solution to this problem. Workaround: Save via email instead.
			</ul>
			<h3>March 25, 2000. enCore version 2.0.5</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a permission issue with $player.Xpress_Notebook and $player.Xpress_Log. Both properties are now -rc
				<li>Removed the following verbs $encore_web_utils:text_save_options $Xpress_Navigator:log_options and $encore_web_application:generate_plain_text. A revised save to disk system makes these verbs obsolete. The property $httpd.text_mime_types was removed for the same reason. See below.
				<li>Added properties $player.Xpress_Confunc_Msg, $Xpress_Client.MOTD_Msg, $Xpress_Client.MOTD_viewer_list, $Xpress_MOO_Mailer.messages_to_display. The MOTD (Message of the day) properties are not being used right now, but was added in preparation for new features in an upcoming version.
				<li>Added a series of reserved characters and words to $player_db.reserved
				<li>Modified $encore_web_utils:form so that 'simple' forms beginning with only a FORM tag is no longer possible. This was done to ensure that all forms are received as POSTs by Xpress.
				<li>Rewrote $xpress_navigator:MOO-Log to fix problems with lost logs. The new system should prevent loss of data.
				<li>Updated $Xpress_Navigator:Xpress_Notebook to take advantage of new features. See below.
				<li>Wrote a new system that allows the Log and Notebook applications to save data to disk or via email. Contents in these applications can now also be erased. New verb $xpress_Navigator:save_via_email was added.
				<li>Fixed a small issue with $Xpress_MOO_Mailer:sendmail where the subject was included as the first line of the mail message.
				<li>Added new verb $Xpress_client:Xpress_Confunc. This verb is used to generate various login messages when users connect with Xpress. Called from $xpress_client:menu_html.
				<li>Updated $player:reset_xpress_session. This verb now informs players about aborted logs next time they log in.
				<li>Fixed an issue with $encore_web_utils:make_sound that caused certain browser plug-ins to throw exceptions. Thanks to Matthew Beermann for suggesting this fix.
				<li>Added Matthew Beermann's update to $encore_web_utils:detect_urls. URLs that are already marked up will now be ignored.
				<li>Added a new verb $Xpress_MOO_Mailer:permission_to_read that provides authentication services to Xpress MOO Mailer verbs.
				<li>Rewrote the Xpress Mailer so that only a certain number of messages in a mail box is displayed at any given time. A quick access menu is automatically generated to provide easy access to other messages in the mail box. This update required modifications in $Xpress_MOO_Mailer:contents_html, $Xpress_MOO_Mailer:folders_html, and $xpress_MOO_mailer:view_html.
				<li>Modified $Xpress_property_editor:set_property_html once again. This time I believe the problems related to player names and aliases has been properly adressed through the addition of $Xpress_property_editor:rename and the modification of $player_db:why_bad_name and $encore_web_class:quick_edit.
				<li>Added Matthew Beermann's new version of $encore_web_utils:parse_url that makes it possible for non-$encore_web_applications to have web-enabled verbs other than :_html, so long as they are +x and end in _html
				<li>Updated the following help texts to reflect changes in this version: $encore_help.logging, $encore_help.notebook, and $encore_help.quick_editing.
			</ul>
			<h3>February 13, 2000. enCore version 2.0.4</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a problem with $xpress_client:character_application_html so that information in the form is preserved in case the chosen name is already taken and the form has to be returned to user.
				<li>Modified $xpress_property_editor:main_html call $encore_web_application:blank_html.
				<li>Fixed a rather serious bug in $xpress_property_editor:set_property_html where player names were not treated as special cases, and thus, were not updated in the $player_db. This led to problems with page @join etc for folks who had changed their names using Xpress. Wrote a small utility verb that fixes current name problems.
				<li>Fixed an elusive bug in $encore_web_utils:form where forms were not sent with method POST specified. This caused certain clients such as MSIE to truncate long posts. Thanks to Roxanne Mountford and the OldPuebloMOO wiz team for bringing this to our attention. This should also solve the problems Windows users have had with compiling long verbs and saving long texts.
				<li>The bugfix above led to three other problem with $encore_web_utils:parse_multipart_form_data. 1) Had to trim off leading and trailing quote marks added by the sending client. 2) Had to set the verb - d (-debug) to prevent it from throwing a Range Error 3) Had to comment out an if-statement that began to return empty strings as empty lists. My tests have not yet produced any problems after these changes, but since this is such a crucial verb, it is possible that we'll run into situation that cause problems. Will have to keep an eye on this.
				<li>Modified $who_browser:main_html so that the window closes automatically when clicking on a player name in the who-listing.
				<li>Updated copyright notices in $xpress_client:display_login_page, $encore_web_utils:generate_head and #0.license.
				<li>Modified $player:quick_edit so that it won't show encrypted old password. Some folks have claimed that the old way was confusing.
				<li>Modified $quota_utils:bi_create to avoid an obscure bug that causes $builder:_create and $quota_utils:bi_create to start calling each other in a loop only terminated by the Too many verb calls exception. Thanks to Roxanne Mountford and the OldPuebloMOO wiz team for bringing this to my attention.
				<li>Adjusted certain window sizes to make them larger and better looking in Microsoft Windows.
			</ul>
