MOOtcan
-------

is a simple MOO-client applet. it currently has support for showing URLs in a
browser frame. In the future it will probably also support the MCP.

much work has been done to make it work under as many Java Virtual Machines as
possible.

it has support for history, by pressing page-up and page-down (or ctrl-up and
ctrl-down). the history-items are editable; if you are currently editing some
text, and you want to refer to something you wrote earlier, the applet will
remember what you were editing.

I did some work to get updating of the outputarea as fast as possible.
java.awt.TextArea updates very slow, and even slower on some implementations.
the workaround is to update it in chunks, instead of updating it for every
line. now it scrolls about at the same speed as TinyFugue (MOO/MUD client for
text terminals).

the code is mixed java-1.0 & java-1.1. when run under java-1.1 the TextAreas
are a lot nicer, i.e. we get rid of superfluous scrollbars etc. but it should
work under java-1.0 (except under Netscape 3.x for unix).

currently it is line-oriented only, so it's probably not usable for
character-oriented MUDs etc.

see COPYING for copyright information. see INSTALL for info about installing
and running.
