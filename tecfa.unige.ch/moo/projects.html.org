<H1>TecfaMOO Projects</H1>

We started the TecfaMOO around November 1994. At that time it wasn't
a real project, but something like "let's have MOO and see what we can do".
A few ideas have come up since then, i.e. see the
<A HREF="questions.html">short information on TecfaMOO</A> (including a list research questions). Some of those ideas have turned into more
serious projects or at least "usages".

(Documentation, Teaching, and Technology Transfert)

<H3>Documentation on MOOs and MOOing</H3>

Documentation on MOOs and MOOing is sometimes hard find and certain things
are missing. Therefore we decided to spend some effort on that.

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="book1/tm.html">The evolving TecfaMOO book - part I</A>
This is an unfinished attempt to build a MOO resource book.

<LI>Also, we decided to created educational MUD/text-base VR resource pages
and host other information useful for the community.
See: <A HREF="moocommunity.html">for details</A>.

<H3>MOO Education at TECFA</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Our Diploma Students are introduced to text-based VR (MOOs) in 2 courses:
<A HREF="http://tecfa.unige.ch/tecfa/teaching/staf14/staf14-overview.html">Staf14 </A>
(Systèmes d'Information et Communication Médiatisés par Ordinateur) and
<A HREF="http://tecfa.unige.ch/tecfa/teaching/staf2x/">Staf2x</A> (Atelier de programmation).
See the <A HREF="education.html">MOO Education at Tecfa</A> page
for details.

<LI><A HREF="stu_projects.html">TecfaMOO Student Projects</A>
(Staf-14 1994/95)

In the future some student work may be associated with bigger research
projects. Also some may evolve into master thesis or practical work
requirement (stage).
 <P>
Documentation developed for our courses may be of use to others:
See the <A HREF="builders.html">Builder's and Programmer's Information</A>page.

<H3>Technology Transfert: Increase the popularity of MOOs</H3>

E.g. "Easy" publications and conferences, as well as organization of workshops.

See the Mystery train (<A HREF="http://tecfamoo.unige.ch:7777/1647">#1647</A>) which is an experimental setup.

<H2>MOO as CMC Tool for teaching and cooperation</H2>
<UL>
<LI>TecfaMOO is increasingly used as non-intrusive
CMC tool for internal communication
<LI>Since our <a href="http://tecfa.unige.ch/tecfa/tecfa-teaching/teaching-overview.html#postgrad">postgraduate "STAF"</a>diploma in educational technology is organized as
"semi-distance curriculum", the MOO is being also increasingly used to
communicate with our students at remote sites.
<LI>We are hosting virtual sessions of researchers (e.g. people from
<A HREF="http://tecfa.unige.ch/tecfa/tecfa-research/lhm/lhm-overview.html">the ESF/LHM programme</A>).
See the
<A HREF="VMDL/VMDL-1.html">The VDML/MOO report</A> for more details.

<LI>The international Pangea project brings together kids from 3 continents
</UL>
Some of these uses of TecfaMOO might be turned into research projects.
(remember that Tecfa is a unit in educational technology, so we might
do some self-observation too).
