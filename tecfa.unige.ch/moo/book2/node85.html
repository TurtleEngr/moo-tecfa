<P>
Now let's program a verb that allows you to display an item to the people
in the room or everything. So we want a verb that does something like:
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   show 3 on holder</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
This would display item 3 in the list if it existed. If it doesn't it
would warn the player that such an item does not exist.
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   show all on holder</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
should display all information in the holder. Here is the verb
and you can grab the verb from 
<A NAME="tex2html160" HREF="code/code-show.moo">here</A>.
Now let's examine the code.
Note that to list a verb in the MOO you can use the @list command as
below. Please note, that the line numbers in front of each lines are added
by the '@list' command for your convenience. So don't ever type them when
you program the verb yourself!
It is useful to display line numbers when you quickly want to list a verb
in order to see where it broke (grin).
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>&gt;@l holder:show
#2108:&quot;show&quot;   any (on top of/on/onto/upon) this
 1:&quot;This verb will print out either all objects or a selected item
   on the holding&quot;;
 2:&quot;property to the room. Tests are made to insure that the direct
   object string&quot;;
 3:&quot;represents a number AND an number not bigger than the length of the list&quot;;
 4:  n_items = length(this.holding);
 5:  &quot; --- showing all the items ---- &quot;;
 6:  if (dobjstr == &quot;all&quot;)
 7:    player.location:announce_all(player.name, &quot; shows all the items on &quot;,
       this.name);
 8:    for k in [1..n_items]
 9:      player.location:announce_all(k, &quot;: &quot;, this.holding[k]);
10:    endfor
11:  else
12:    &quot; ---- testing bad dobjstr's ----&quot;;
13:    NUM = tonum(dobjstr);
14:    if (NUM == 0)
15:      player:tell(&quot;The correct syntax for the show command is:
         'show all on &lt;object&gt;' or show &lt;number&gt; on &lt;object&gt;&quot;);
16:    elseif (NUM &gt; n_items)
17:      player:tell(&quot;Sorry this list has less items then &quot;, NUM);
18:    else
19:      &quot; ---- displaying a single element ----&quot;;
20:      player.location:announce_all(player.name, &quot; shows item &quot;, NUM,
         &quot; on &quot;, this.name, &quot;: &quot;, this.holding[NUM]);
21:    endif
22:  endif

.</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
Now, please program this verb by entering the code or by copying it:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> First, create the verb argument specification like this. In case your
are working at <B>TECFA</B><TT>MOO</TT><b> skip this step</b> and go directly to the
next step, i.e. use the @copy command (see next step)
without defining the verb first.
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>     @verb holder:show any on this</PRE></SMALL>
Note that if you don't have an idea on verb argument specification
(the ``<code>show any on this</code>'') you now should go an read
section <A HREF="node115.html#secverbspec">10.4.2</A> on verb argument specification
on page <A HREF="node115.html#secverbspec"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://tecfa.unige.ch/gif/tex2html//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>. This section will also teach you
how to change arguments in case you entered a wrong specification.
<LI> Then program the verb in the same way as you programmed your
  other 2 verbs, i.e. type: '@edit holder:show'.  Now instead of
  manually typing the code, you can grab it over the Net (see above)
  and paste it into the editing buffer (or whatever technique for
  uploading code you prefer). At <B>TECFA</B><TT>MOO</TT> you can simply
 <code>'@copy #2108:show to &lt;your object&gt;'</code>.
 This will copy the verb from and object
on which it already exists to your object.
<P>
</OL>
Then, play around with the verb trying out various variations to convince
yourself that it works. This verb is not perfect and we suggest that
make some modifications later.
The main goal of this
part of the tutorial is to teach you how a basic algorithm works
and how to understand somewhat longer code. In case you don't understand
in detail how this code works, there are 3 solutions:
<OL>
<LI> You try to figure out by ``hand'' what the code does, i.e. you
try to imagine step by step what will happen when this procedure runs.
<LI> You insert a lot of ``print'' statements in the code that will
print out variable values. To do that, you can insert either something like:
  <UL>
<LI> player:tell(``variable k ='' , k);<BR> 
This solution is not great since lists will be printed as ``list''
<LI> player:notify(``variable k ='' , k);
<LI> player:report(``variable k ='' , k);<BR> 
works only in certain MOOs.
  </UL>
<LI> The best solution is to run TECFA's (Boris Borcic's)
Code animator in the Xemacs client. It will in the editor buffer replace
variables by values in the code in step by step fashion, so you can
really see what the code does.
<P>
</OL>
Now let's examine new features of the MOO language we use in this verb.
<P>
<OL>
<LI> You can insert comments in your code that will be remembered by
the server. Simply write a statement enclosed by quotes, e.g.
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>    &quot; ---- displaying a single element ----&quot;;</PRE></SMALL>
<LI> In this verb we use another variant of the ``for'' loop statement.
In the ``dump'' verb we used a ``do list'' construction, whereas here
we use a ``do times'' construction, i.e. we don't tell the loop to run
once over each item of a list, but we tell it to run N times (from number n1
to number n2)
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   for &lt;variable&gt; in [&lt;beginning&gt;..&lt;end&gt;]</PRE></SMALL>
Here is an example:
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   for k in [2..10]</PRE></SMALL>
will do 2 things. (1) It will loop <code>&lt;end&gt; - \verb&lt;beginning&gt;</code> times
, e.g 10-2 = 8 times in the above example. (2) It will assign the ``index''
of the current loop to the counter <code>&lt;variable&gt;</code>. I.e. the loop will
assign k=2 in the first loop and finish with k=10. Note that in the
``show'' verb we use the iteration index ``k'' to access the nth element
in the list hold by the ``this.holding'' property.
<LI> Elements of lists can be accessed with the following syntax
(see the section 
<A NAME="tex2html161" HREF="http://tecfa.unige.ch/guides/MOO/ProgMan/ProgrammersManual_17.html#SEC17">on Indexing into Lists and Strings</A>
in the MOO Programmers Manuel for more details):
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   &lt;list&gt;[&lt;element number&gt;]

Examples:
   {0,1,2,3,4}[2]   ==&gt; will return 1
   this.holding[3]  ==&gt; will return the 3rd element</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
Note that accessing lists out of range (e.g. element 5 in a list of 4 elements) will produce
an error ! The built-in ``length()'' will tell you the length of the list and you
can test list access like we did in the ``:show'' verb:
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE> 4:  n_items = length(this.holding);
 ......
16:    elseif (NUM &gt; n_items)
17:      player:tell(&quot;Sorry this list has less items then &quot;, NUM);</PRE></SMALL>
<LI> The most important new item of the MOO programming are conditional
statements (IFs). See the section on
<A NAME="tex2html162" HREF="http://tecfa.unige.ch/guides/MOO/ProgMan/ProgrammersManual_31.html#SEC31">Statements for Testing Conditions</A>
 in the MOO programmers Manual.
Here we just reproduce an abstract pseudo code
definition of what happens in the ``show verb''.
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE> 6:  if (``the direct object string is EQUAL to &quot;all&quot;)
     ``do print out all statements'';
11:  else
14:    if (``the direct object string is not a number, e.g. 0!'')
       ``then complain to the user'';
16:    elseif (NUM &gt; n_items)
       ``else if we were able to create a number BUT the number is
        too big complain too'';
18:    else
       ``print a single element;
21:    endif
22:  endif</PRE></SMALL>
So IFs can be nested and alternative conditions ``else'' or ``else if'' exist.
Note that the (conditional) and the keywords ``else'' and ``elseif'' belong
to the same statement, so no ``;'' is needed for them! Here is the same
same structure as in the ``show verb'' even more simplified.
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   if (condition1)
     ``do something'';
     ``do something more complex'';
   else
     if (condition2)
        ``do something else'';
     elseif (condition*)
        ``do something else'';
     else
        ``do something else again''
     endif
   endif</PRE></SMALL>
<LI> Conditional expressions are used for example in IF statements and
they return a truth value, i.e. the expression on line 6:
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>      (dobjstr == &quot;all&quot;)</PRE></SMALL>
is either 1 (= true) or 0 (=false). Please remember that equality tests are
done with the ``=='' operator and NOT with a simple ``='' which is an assignment.
<LI> The tonum() built-in function in line 13
will translate a string to a number. 
If conversion is not possible, the number is 0.
Try it out by typing ';tonum(``bla'') to the MOO client.
The length() function in line 4 returns the length of a list.
As we explained in section <A HREF="node77.html#secfunctionalprog">8.2.4</A> functions always
return a value. You will learn later how to build your own
function verbs. All built-in functions are explained in the
MOO manual or in the MOO (type 'help functions').
<LI> An other built-in function allows displaying messages to the people
in the same room. Each room (normally) has a ``announce_all'' verb that works
in a similar way as player:tell. The latter only displays something to the
player who typed the command. Each player has a location  property containing
the room object the player is currently in. So all we need to run this
verb is to use the following kind of statement:
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE> 9:      player.location:announce_all(k, &quot;: &quot;, this.holding[k]);</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
</OL>
<P>
That's it ! Again: try to study this verb until you are sure how it works.
As we said you can insert statements that print out intermediary variables
or whatever you want to you. I.e. if you want to be sure that the counter works
right in the for loop, insert this into the loop after line 8 or 9:
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>player:tell(&quot;K= &quot;, k);</PRE></SMALL>
