Let's program a very simple object just for the fun of it.
It will not do anything useful, but teach you a few basic things.
You will not learn much about programming, nor about MOO objects
and verbs but you will get the ``feel'' for doing more difficult things
later on.
If you don't want to do something too simple, you can instead work
directly on the next tutorial in section <A HREF="node80.html#sectutorial1">8.4</A>
on page <A HREF="node80.html#sectutorial1"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://tecfa.unige.ch/gif/tex2html//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.

<BLOCKQUOTE> Ok, let's assume that you sometimes hate something, e.g. your boss
or your computer. Now let's program a simple objet that you can kick
and that will help you to get rid of your frustrations.
</BLOCKQUOTE><H4><A NAME="SECTION04130010000000000000">STEP 1 - Creating an Object:</A></H4>
<P>
First of all, we have to tell the MOO to create an object on which
you can work, to do this <b>type now:</b>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>&gt;@create $thing named computer</PRE></SMALL>
The MOO now will reply with something like:
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>You now have computer with object number #4134
and parent generic thing (#5).</PRE></SMALL>
Each object you create has a unique number (which will allow you
to find it everywhere). To make <em>really sure</em> that you indeed
now own an object called computer, <b>type now</b>:
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>  @audit me</PRE></SMALL>
You will get a listing of all objects you own (including yourself and
rooms and exits you may have built). Also note that when you create
an object with the <code>@create</code> command it will be ``on you'', i.e.
in your inventory. If you don't believe this, type now: ``<code>inv</code>''.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION04130020000000000000">STEP 2 - Adding a description</A></H4>
<P>
Now look at your object, i.e. <b>type now:</b>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   look computer</PRE></SMALL>
You will ``see nothing special'' of course. So the first thing you do
is to add a description, <b>type now:</b>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   @describe computer as A really disgusting looking little PC.</PRE></SMALL>
Now look at it again! Note that you can enter a different description
of course if your machine has nice looks. Just do the <code>@describe</code>
command again.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION04130030000000000000">STEP 3 - Let's add a command verb</A></H4>
<P>
Since you sometimes hate your computer you want to kick it sometimes, right ?
Now kicking objects is not a standard command in a MOO unless it is
on some social feature (see section <A HREF="node32.html#secsocialfeatures">2.4</A>). What we do
now is add a ``kick'' verb just for this ``computer'' (more explanations
later). For now <b>just type this:</b> (be very careful to type
exactly this and nothing else)
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>@verb computer:kick this any any</PRE></SMALL>
The MOO now should reply something like:
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>Verb added  #4134:&quot;kick&quot;  this any any  rd  (1)</PRE></SMALL>
Note the object number <code>#4134</code> will not be the same since <em>your</em> computer has a different number ! In case you did something wrong (like
forgetting the ``this any any'', type ``<code>@rmverb computer:kick</code>''.
This will kill what you did. Note that you can also kill the whole object
with the command ``<code>@recycle computer</code>'', but then you have
to restart with STEP 1.
<P>
<b>Very important:</b> Don't use this ``<code>@verb</code>'' command more than
once !! Else you will wind up with several verbs.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION04130040000000000000">STEP 4 - Let's program the command verb</A></H4>
<P>
Type the <b>exact</b> 3 following lines now to program the verb:
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>  @program #4134:kick
  player:tell(&quot;The &quot;, this.name, &quot; yells: AIEAIE&quot;);
  .</PRE></SMALL>
Don't forget the dot. Actually, when you type your verb you will see
something like this:
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>  &gt;@program #4134:kick
   Now programming #4134:&quot;kick&quot;  this any any  rd  (1)
   [Type lines of input; use `.' at the beginning of a NEW LINE
   to end your input or type `@abort' to abort the command.]
  &gt;player:tell(&quot;The &quot;, this.name, &quot; yells: AIEAIE&quot;);
  &gt;.
   0 errors.
   Verb programmed.</PRE></SMALL>
In case you encounter an error, <b>just restart until it works</b>.
In most MOO clients you can recall the previous command, edit the line
and send it back.
You may encounter another problem: the MOO seems to be stuck. In this
case you forgot to enter the ``.'' on a <b>new line</b>. Do it !
<P>
Here is a typical error you might have done, e.g. you forgot
a  ``<code>*&quot;</code>'' as in the following example:
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   &gt;@program #4134:kick
   Now programming #4134:&quot;kick&quot;  this any any  rd  (1)
   [Type lines of input; use `.' at the beginning of a NEW LINE to end your input or type `@abort' to abort the command.]
   &gt;player:tell(&quot;The , this.name, &quot;yells: AIEAIE&quot;);
   &gt;.
   Line 1:  parse error
   1 error(s).
   Verb not programmed.</PRE></SMALL>
The first and the third line are moo commands necessary to define a
verb. The second line is the real program you wrote. Note that
we use a builtin MOO function ``<code>player:tell</code>'' that will
print out something to the person that uses a verb.
This function must be called with a list of <em>arguments</em> that
are printed back to the user. In our case we have 3 arguments:
<OL>
<LI> &quot;The &quot;
<LI> this.name
<LI> &quot; yells: AIEAIE&quot;
</OL>
The first and the third are simple <em>strings</em> that are printed to
the user. The second one is more complex: it refers to the name
of the objects on which the verb is programmed, i.e. your computer.
Using a variable instead of a string ``computer'' makes your verb
more versatile as you will see in step 5.
<P>
Note that when you program more complex commands than this ``1 line'' procedure
you will use an editor to do this. (We will explain this in the
next tutorial in section <A HREF="node83.html#level1firstverb">8.4.3</A> on page <A HREF="node83.html#level1firstverb"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://tecfa.unige.ch/gif/tex2html//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>)
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION04130050000000000000">STEP 5 - Testing</A></H4>
<P>
To test your ``computer'', <b>type now</b> like in the following transcript:
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   &gt;kick computer
    The computer yells: AIEAIE</PRE></SMALL>
Hey it works ! Now, if you happen to hate your boss, just rename the object
as in the following example:
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   &gt;@rename computer to boss
   Name of #4134 changed to &quot;boss&quot;, with aliases {&quot;boss&quot;}.
   &gt;kick boss
   The boss yells: AIEAIE</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
How come it works ? Well, go and do the next tutorial
(section <A HREF="node80.html#sectutorial1">8.4</A>). It will teach
you much more. However, it will take you about 4 to 8 hours to master
it. Ok you don't want to learn much more, but just a little bit more,
go to STEP 6 now.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION04130060000000000000">STEP 6 - Counting the kicks</A></H4>
<P>
Ok so you really hate your boss and you think that other's hate him
too. Now let's add a counter to count all the kicks.
In this case you need a <b>``property''</b> on your ``boss'' object
to count the kicks. A property is some kind of place where you
can store information on an object.
<P>
Add <b>it now</b> with the following command
(make sure you type it right):
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>@prop boss.kicks 0</PRE></SMALL>
The MOO will display something like this:
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>Property added with value 0.</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
Now you have to modify the verb of course. Enter the following lines
as below or use a MOO editor if you allready know how to do this.
If you don't you should actually learn it <b>now</b>
e.g. by glancing at the relevant text in
in section <A HREF="node83.html#level1firstverb">8.4.3</A> on page <A HREF="node83.html#level1firstverb"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://tecfa.unige.ch/gif/tex2html//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>):
Before you start typing make sure that you enter ``<code>player:tell(&quot;The &quot;, this.name, &quot; having been hit allready &quot;, this.kicks, &quot; times, yells: AIEAIE&quot;);</code>'' on a <b>single</b> line !!
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   @program #4134:kick
   player:tell(&quot;The &quot;, this.name, &quot; having been hit allready &quot;,
this.kicks, &quot; times, yells: AIEAIE&quot;);
   this.kicks = this.kicks + 1;
   .</PRE></SMALL>
The line ``<code>this.kicks = this.kicks </code> 1;'' will increase the
kicks property on your object each time the verb is called. This
construct is called a counter by the way. Also note that we had to
modify the ``<code>player:tell</code>'' verb to display the kicks received
so far.
Now test your verb again! You should see something like:
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>  &gt;kick boss
  The boss having been hit allready 6 times, yells: AIEAIE</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION04130070000000000000">STEP 7 - Making sure you can do it alone</A></H4>
<P>
Ok so actually you <em>love</em> your boss (sometimes). Well add
a second verb called ``hug''. Just redo step 3 to step 6
with a different verb !
