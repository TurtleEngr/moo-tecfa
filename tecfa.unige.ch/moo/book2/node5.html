First of all you need to able to connect to a MOO (see section
<A HREF="node6.html#secConnecting">1.3</A> for instructions).
<P>
Here is some basic information on how to do the most basic actions in
a MOO. You can always type <EM>'help'</EM> to get an index of help topics. To
get specific help about communication, for example, you can type 'help
communication'.
<P>
MOOs are organized around ``rooms'', i.e. you are always in some
location. So a first thing you need to learn is how to look at the
room you're in: Just type<EM>'look'</EM>. To get information on the objects
around you, you can type<EM>'look &lt;object&gt;'</EM>.
<P>
To communicate with people in the same room you're in, you can ``talk''
to them by typing something like:
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   say Hello, there.
      - or -
   &quot;Hello, there</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
To know who else is connected at the time, type <EM>'@who'</EM>. You get also
information on where they are, for how long they have been connected,
and when they were active last. To communicate with people not in your
room, you can 'page' them like in the following example:
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   page Jane Do you have some free time?</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
If you want to go to another room, you can walk though an ``exit''
<EM>by typing the exit's name</EM>. Exits are normally listed when you 'look'
like in the following example:
<P>
On most MOOs, even guests are allowed to ``join'' a person, i.e. jump
to the same location. But please, before you join a person page her
and ask if you are welcome !
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   @join jane</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
If you want to look at things, use the ``look'' command, like in
the following examples:
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   &gt;look
   Daniel's Office
   You see open boxes, a desk and other brand new office furniture
   Obvious Exits: Atrium (to The Tecfa Atrium) and Tower (to Tower).

   Colin
   A young man, having a lot of fun inside the MOO. 
   He stared so much at his screen that he begins to 
   have square eyes. Work, all that matters is work !
   He is awake, but has been staring off into space for 2 hours.</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
Finally, to logoff, type '@quit'
