<P>
Now let's create a verb that will allow you to add an information bit to this
object. There are basically 2 uses for verbs. Either one uses them
as user commands or as procedures called by other procedures
(or user commands).
User commands are a more tricky matter because you have to specify
verb argument types that will allow the command parser to work correctly.
Here we basically will create a
verb called ``add'' that could be used in the following way (don't
enter that command now, it won't work yet!)
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   &gt;add &quot;The MOO is great&quot; to holder</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
You may now have a glance at section <A HREF="node113.html#secverbs">10.4</A> on page
<A HREF="node113.html#secverbs"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://tecfa.unige.ch/gif/tex2html//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> to see how
command parsing works. Otherwise do that later and just type in the
following without understanding details. It is important to type
``@verb ....'' <b>only once for each given verb</b> you want
to program. Else you will wind
up with several verb definitions and the MOO (and yourself) will get 
confused! In case you want to kill a verb (including its definition)
type <code>@rmverb &lt;your object&gt;:verb</code>, e.g. <code>@rmverb holder:add</code>
in this case. Now, proceed with entering the verb definition:
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   &gt;@verb holder:add any to this

   Verb added (0).</PRE></SMALL>
What we did here was to
define a <b>verb argument specification</b> for a verb called ``add''
that will be attached to the ``holder'' object. The verb will be
activated if it encounters a command like 'add ``the moo is great'' to holder'.
The ``any'' keyword means that any kind of input could be entered.
The ``to'' keyword means that the ``to'' preposition has to typed.
The ``this'' keyword means that the indirect object should match the
object to which the verb belongs (or as you will learn later some
generic object from which an object inherits the verb).
<P>
Warning: <b>if you forgot to enter the right verb specifications</b>
e.g. ``<code>any to this</code>'', do not add another verb with the @verb
command but change the argument specification with the <code>@args</code>
command, e.g. type: <code>@args holder:add any to this</code>.
<P>
Now let's program the verb itself. Note that we assume here that you know
how to use the in-MOO text editor, or that you use a client
that can ship editing to a local editor (see section <A HREF="node12.html#secClients">1.4</A>). 
In the latter case, make sure to have local editing set.
('@edito +l will do that).
<P>
Now type <code>'@edit holder:add'</code>.
<P>
(1) If (and only if) you ship <b>editing to a local client</b>, you will see this in your editing buffer:
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>----------------------------------------------------------------------
@program #2108:add
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------</PRE></SMALL>
DON'T delete the first and the last line and insert all programming lines
in between those! To ship the text back to the MOO in the <b>rmoo client</b>,
type <code>ctrl-c ctrl-s</code>. In other MOO clients, the command may be
different. Note that you can reuse the same buffer as many times as
you like. In other words, once you are editing a verb you can make as
many modifications as you like and ship them back to the MOO each time.
<P>
(2) Alternatively,
<b>if you use the in-MOO Verb editor</b> (discouraged but sometimes you have
to) you have to learn how to use it (type 'look' and 'help'
and you will see something like this:
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>----------------------------------------------------------------------
Verb Editor

Do a 'look' to get the list of commands, or 'help' for assistance.

Now editing #111:test (any any any).
----------------------------------------------------------------------</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
Now back to programming.
The ``add'' verb needs to do 2 basic things: (1) add the ``information bit''
to the ``holding'' property and (2) inform you that it did so. To do that
we need to program the following lines:
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  this.holding = {@this.holding, dobjstr};
  player:tell(&quot;Inserted ''&quot;, dobjstr, &quot;'' to &quot;, this.name);
  --------------------------------------------------------------------</PRE></SMALL>
If you are using a MOO client that does local editing (tkMOO lite or
emacs for instance, you should produce something like this
in your editing window (the object number will be different of course):
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>--------------------------------------------------------------------
@program #2108:add
  this.holding = {@this.holding, dobjstr};
  player:tell(&quot;Inserted ''&quot;, dobjstr, &quot;'' to &quot;, this.name);
.
--------------------------------------------------------------------</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
Those two lines already contain several features of the MOO programming
language. If the MOO complains about bad syntax, like in the following
example, you mistyped something:
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   Line 2:  parse error
   1 error(s).
   Verb not programmed.</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
Be sure to type in those 2 lines as above. Note that statements in the
MOO language need to separated by ``;'' so don't forget them!
Errors are usually due to:
<OL>
<LI> Missing ``;''
<LI> Misspelling of builtin functions or verbs
<LI> Unmatched parenthesis or quotes
<P>
</OL>
<P>
You can now try out your new verb. Use it as in the specification
above (e.g. type 'add ``anything you like'' to holder' to the MOO).
If you want to be sure that it worked, examine the object ``holder''.
E.g. type:
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   @d holder.
     - or -
   ;#&lt;object&gt;.holding</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
The ``;'' lets you evaluate simple expressions directly in the MOO
without really programming a verb.
Now let's look at the first line (reproduced below)
in the ``add'' verb you started programming.
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>  this.holding = {@this.holding, dobjstr};</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
<OL>
<LI> It assigns a value to the slot ``holding'' on the object on which
the verb runs (the object named ``holder'' in our case). Assignments
are done with a ``='' assignment statement. So permanent assignment
statements are done in the following way:
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>       &lt;object&gt;.&lt;property&gt; = &lt;something...&gt;

       Examples:

       Player.name = &quot;Animal&quot; ;
       this.holding = {&quot;not very much&quot;, &quot;a lot more''} ;
       #237.xxx = 123+7-a ;</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
The value of the expression to the <b>right</b> of the ``='' sign is
set as value of the property addressed to the left. To access the
``holding'' property on the ``holder'' object, we can use a construction
like <code>this.holding</code>. ``this'' is a built-in variable that represents
the object on which the verb runs. Those built-in variables allow you
to write code that can be used by a whole class of objects.
<LI> On the right hand side of the ``='' we find a list construction
expression: <code>{@this.holding, dobjstr}</code> which does the following
thing:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> the <code>{ ...}</code> builds a list out of the comma-separated elements.
<LI>  In this context, the ``@'' is a splicing operator that instructs 
the server to take not the list itself but its elements.
<LI> I.e. what we do here is telling the server to build a list from
the elements which are already set to the property 
in the list (<code>@this.holding</code>) and to add the new element ``dobjstr''.
<LI> ``dojbstr'' is another built-in variable that a verb can access
and it corresponds to the ``direct object representation'' the parser
found when a command was entered. In other words, if a user will
type <code>'add &quot;rdv demain avec Chris&quot; to holder'</code>, the builtin
variable <code>dbjstr</code> will have the value <code>&quot;rdv demain avec Chris&quot;</code>
and the MOO will hand this value to the verb you are programming now.
See section <A HREF="node118.html#secmoovariables">10.5.2</A> on page <A HREF="node118.html#secmoovariables"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://tecfa.unige.ch/gif/tex2html//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>
if you want to know more about those right now. Else go on!
<P>
</UL></OL>
<P>
If you don't understand the concept of splicing consider the following
cases. In the first case we use an <code>@a</code> and the list created
is a flat list. In the second case we don't use the <code>@</code> and
we produce a list within a list, something we do not want here.
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>&gt;;;a={&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;}; a={@a,&quot;d&quot;}; return(a)
=&gt; {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;}

&gt;;;a={&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;}; a={a,&quot;d&quot;}; return(a)
=&gt; {{&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;}, &quot;d&quot;}</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
Note that we did not program a verb here
but we used the <b>evaluator functionality</b> of the moo, which allows
you to test simple things without writing a procedure.
Please read section <A HREF="node162.html#secbasiceval">16.6.1</A> on page <A HREF="node162.html#secbasiceval"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://tecfa.unige.ch/gif/tex2html//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>
if you want to know more about playing around with the evaluator.
But now, let's examine line 2:
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   player:tell(&quot;Inserted ''&quot;, dobjstr, &quot;'' to &quot;, this.name);</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
It runs the ``tell'' verb that (this time) is attached
to the player, i.e. the person who typed the command.
This line shows how to call other verbs from within a verb you are programming.
The general syntax for verb calls is the following:
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>&lt;verb&gt;(&lt;argument 1&gt;, &lt;argument 2&gt;, &lt;argument 3&gt;, ...);
          e.g. 
player:tell(&quot;Inserted &quot;, dobjstr, &quot;  to &quot;, this.name);</PRE></SMALL>
i.e. arguments are given in parenthesis, separated by commas.
<A NAME="tex2html157" HREF="http://tecfa.unige.ch/moo/book2//footnode.html#981"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://tecfa.unige.ch/gif/tex2html//foot_motif.gif"></A>
``:tell'' accepts an arbitrary number of arguments, you can either
use values or literals (e.g. strings in our case).
<P>
Be sure to put commas between EACH argument and watch out for
quotes (&quot;) to be displayed to the player! Since <code>&quot;</code> are
used to delimit a string, you can't just have some <code>&quot;</code>
inside the string.
Therefore, either use some other character
to put quotes around words (e.g. <code>''</code> (2 simple quotes)
or better use <b>escaped</b> quotes: <code>\"</code>. The following
expressions are conceptually equivalent:
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>                &quot;escaping&quot; the quotes:

  player:tell(&quot;Inserted \&quot;&quot;, dobjstr, &quot;\" to &quot;, this.name);

                or using any kind other character(s):

  player:tell(&quot;Inserted ''&quot;, dobjstr, &quot;'' to &quot;, this.name);
  player:tell(&quot;Inserted `&quot;, dobjstr, &quot;' to &quot;, this.name);
  player:tell(&quot;Inserted &lt;&lt;&quot;, dobjstr, &quot;&gt;&gt; to &quot;, this.name);</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
It is left as an exercise to the reader to figure out what each
argument to the ``:tell'' verb will print. Play around with
the MOO evaluator if you want, however the dobjstr variable
will be empty, but something like this would work:
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>      ;player:tell(&quot;this is my &quot;, player.name)</PRE></SMALL>
