For simple room and exit creation, the <code>@dig</code> verb should be
enough (so can skip reading this is you are in a hurry).
However, there are situations where you need to know a few
additional commands, e.g. when you want to remove an exit or an
entrance or when 2 people want to link rooms they own.
In the latter case you can use the @dig command to create and
exit and an entrance, but <code>@dig</code> will complain. Don't worry,
but write down the numbers of the created exits and ask the
owner of the other room to add them with the
<code>@add-entrance</code>
<code>@add-exit</code> commands (see below)
Here is an example:
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>&gt;@dig door|back to #1111

Exit from island (#1429) to TecfaMOO ARRIVAL area (#1111) via {&quot;door&quot;}
created with id #4194.
However, I couldn't add #4194 as a legal entrance to TecfaMOO ARRIVAL
area.  You may have to get its owner, Daniel to add it for you.

Exit to island (#1429) via {&quot;back&quot;} created with id #3997.  However, I
couldn't add #3997 as a legal exit from TecfaMOO ARRIVAL area.  Get
its owner, Daniel to add it for you.</PRE></SMALL>
So the exit you have created in <b>your room</b>
must be added as an <b>entrance</b> to the other room
and the 
entrance you have created from the other room
leading back to <b>your room</b>
must be added as an <b>exit</b> to the other room!
<b>Warning: Dealing with exits can be very tricky!</b>
Don't just <code>@dig</code> lots of rooms and exits without really checking
what happened, else you may wind up with many exits that are in
nowhere space ! Also be very careful when you recycle rooms.
Double check before you hit return and recycle a room that
you don't want to destroy. If it happens you need a programmer
bit to restore all exits and entrances to connected rooms or
else recycle them too and rebuild everything!
<P>
The following information on exit commands
is straight from the MOOs help system:
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>help @exits
Syntax:  @exits

Prints a list of all conventional exits from the current room (but
only if you own the room).  A conventional exit is one that can be
used simply by typing its name, like 'east'.</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>&gt;help @entrances
Syntax:  @entrances

Prints a list of all recognized entrances to the current room (but
only if you own the room).  A recognized entrance is one whose use is
not considered to be teleportation.</PRE></SMALL>
Note that sometimes you can't list exits and entrances of rooms you
don't own.
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>help @add-exit
Syntax:  @add-exit &lt;exit-object-number&gt;

Add the exit with the given object number as a conventional exit from
the current room (that is, an exit that can be invoked simply by
typing its name, like 'east').  Usually, @dig does this for you, but
it doesn't if you don't own the room in question.  Instead, it tells
you the object number of the new exit and you have to find the owner
of the room and get them to use the @add-exit command to link it up.</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>&gt;help @add-entrance
Syntax:  @add-entrance &lt;exit-object-number&gt;

Add the exit with the given object number as a recognized entrance to
the current room (that is, one whose use is not considered
teleportation).  Usually, @dig does this for you, but it doesn't if
you don't own the room in question.  Instead, it tells you the object
number of the new exit and you have to find the owner of the room and
get them to use the @add-entrance command to link it up.</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>&gt;help @remove-exit
Syntax:  @remove-exit &lt;exit&gt;

Remove the specified exit from the current exits list of the room.
Exit may be either the name or object number of an exit from this
room.</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>&gt;help @remove-entrance
Syntax:  @remove-entrance &lt;entrance&gt;

Remove the specified entrance from the current entrances list of the
room.  Entrance may be either the name or object number of an entrance
to this room.</PRE></SMALL>
