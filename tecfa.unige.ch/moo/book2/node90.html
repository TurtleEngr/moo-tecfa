This section will teach you how to write simple ``social'' verbs,
i.e. verbs that just send messages around and do not modify the
contents of any object. Ususally that kind of verb is made available
in social features, but before writing and propagating those, it
is better to write a few just for your own character.&lt;
In order to do the
the Generic Objects and Permission Tutorial
(see section <A HREF="node102.html#secpermtutorial">8.10</A>)
you don't need this section. So not much ``tutoring'' is done here
and we rely on
you for picking up the challenge!
Feel free to pick it up later (i.e. once you know how to make
generic objects and feature objects).
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION04150010000000000000">The &quot;grumble&quot; verb</A></H4>
<P>
Get the code from <A NAME="tex2html163" HREF="code/code-grumble.moo">here</A> if
you want to play around with this verb.
Then write your own social verb !
<P>
This verb shows a few more MOO programming tricks, all
related to sending messages to users:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> This time we use a ``any to any'' verb specification. The reason
is the following one. We want to say something like:
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   grumble ``now this is really too much'' to somebody</PRE></SMALL>
The first ``any'' specifier means that we can type in anything (e.g.
a string) and the second ``any'' specifier means that we do not
operate this verb on a specific object; ``any'' in this means
a random user name.
<LI> When you type a command like 'grumble Daniel' the MOO will try
to find the object associated with the string ``Daniel''.
This only works if the named object (``Daniel'' here) is in the same
room. If found, it will set the variable <code>iobj</code> to the <code>#object</code>.
But if no object was found, iobj will be not
valid and we have to work out what to do with iobstr (see below).
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>    8:  if (!valid(iobj))</PRE></SMALL>
<LI> Since the MOO parser does not find the addressee for us over distance
(players in other rooms) we have to
use a Lambda core utility function:
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>    9:    addressee = $string_utils:match_player(iobjstr);</PRE></SMALL>
The ``iobj'' builtin variable will match IF the person or an object 
is in the same room, if not we set this variable to the player object
 we found (if any is found).
<LI> Contrary to the ``holder'' tutorial (see section <A HREF="node80.html#sectutorial1">8.4</A>)
we give differentiated feedback to the player who types the command,
to players in the same room and so forth, e.g.
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   32:    player.location:announce_all_but({addressee, player}, 
          player.name, &quot; grumbles&quot;, mess);</PRE></SMALL>
<LI> In order to page a person in a other room, we use the following verb:
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>   18:    addressee:receive_page(&quot;You hear &quot; + player.name +
          &quot; grumbling at you over distance: &quot;, &quot;    \&quot;&quot; + dobjstr + &quot;!\&quot;&quot;);</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
</OL>
<P>
Here is the code. Please note that some lines have been broken for display
here.
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>@verb me:grumble any to any

----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;@l ~mooboy:grumble
@program ~MooBoy:grumble   any at any
 1:  &quot;The grumble verb allows you to grumble at persons + objects
     in the same room&quot;;
 2:  &quot;as well as to persons in other rooms. Players in the same room will see&quot;;
 3:  &quot;your message, players in the distant room will just notice a grumbling&quot;;
 4:  &quot;The only thing that sucks is that this is a any to any verb&quot;;
 5:  &quot;Try 'grumble this is a test to xxx' to see what I mean&quot;;
 6:  &quot;&quot;;
 7:  &quot; --- test if the object or person is NOT in the same room&quot;;
 8:  if (!valid(iobj))
 9:    addressee = $string_utils:match_player(iobjstr);
10:    &quot; ------ if not, is it a player ?&quot;;
11:    if ($command_utils:player_match_failed(addressee, iobjstr))
12:      player:tell(&quot;This player does not exist nor is there 
         any object of that name in this room&quot;);
13:    else
14:      &quot; ------ it is a player and we can try to page it&quot;;
15:      if (addressee:is_listening())

           &quot; [&quot;, addressee.location.name, &quot;]: \&quot;&quot;, dobjstr, &quot;\&quot;&quot;);
17:        addressee:receive_page(&quot;You hear &quot; + player.name +
           &quot; grumbling at you over distance: &quot;, &quot;    \&quot;&quot; + dobjstr + &quot;!\&quot;&quot;);

           &quot;You vaguely hear that &quot;, player.name, &quot; grumbles something at &quot;,
            addressee.name);
19:      else
20:        player:tell($string_utils:pronoun_sub(&quot;No need to grumble, 
            %s is not connected right now&quot;, addressee));
21:      endif
22:    endif
23:  else
24:    &quot;------ the thing is in the same room, grumbling face to face&quot;;

28:      player:tell(&quot;You grumble&quot;, mess);
29:    else
30:      player:tell(&quot;The &quot;, addressee.name,
         &quot; is not overly impressed by your grumbling.&quot;);

32:    player.location:announce_all_but({addressee, player},
       player.name, &quot; grumbles&quot;, mess);

34:    addressee:tell(&quot; ... maybe you should really start worrying...&quot;);
35:  endif

<P>
Of course, this verb is not perfect yet. One thing missing might be
permissions. right now this verb can be used by an other person
that is in the same rooms as shown in the following examples:
<P>
An other person (e.g. Daniel) that is in the same room
as Mooboy could type:
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE> &gt;grumble &quot;something&quot; to MooBoy
 You grumble &quot;something&quot; to MooBoy</PRE></SMALL>
<P>
and MooBoy would see:
<P>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE> Daniel grumbles at you, &quot;something!&quot;
 ... maybe you should really start worrying...</PRE></SMALL>
This works because the MOO parser will find the ``grumble'' verb on
MOOBoy who is in the same room. Grumbling over distance would not
work as shown in the following example. The reason is that no matching
verb has been found either on the player typing the command, nor the room,
nor any object that has been matched to the command typed.
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>&gt;grumble &quot;watch out&quot; to Thora
I don't understand that.</PRE></SMALL>
We will address this and other security problems in an other tutorial [DOIT!],
but you can look at sections <A HREF="node125.html#secsecurity">11.2</A> (general) or
<A HREF="node133.html#secmuliownprog">12.4</A> (for specific information concerning
<B>TECFA</B><TT>MOO</TT>.)
<P>
Another
problem that could be easily solved is that you can grumble at
persons in the same room that are disconnected. No harm done, but
one could filter that situation too.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION04150020000000000000">The &quot;grab&quot; verb</A></H4>
<P>
Now let's look at a similar social verb, it is a simpler form of the
previous verb, but has a permission check and some randomness built-in:
<P>
Get the code from <A NAME="tex2html164" HREF="code/code-grab.moo">here</A> if
you want to play around with this verb.
Then write your own social verb !
<P>
<OL>
<LI> In line 11 we set the variable messages to a list of messages, something like <code>messages={``a'', ``b'', ``c'',}</code>
<LI> In line 12 we select a random element of this list that will we
displayed. <code>message = messages[random(length(messages))];</code> uses
the builtin random function to select an element of the list. Note that
<code>random(length(&lt;list&gt;)</code> simply means select a random number between
1 and the length of the list (messages in our case).
<LI> In the beginning of the verb (lines 6-9) we check if the caller
  of the verb is the same object as the object to which the verb
  belongs (you in this case). If this is not the case we print out
a message to the caller, i.e. the person who typed the command.
</OL>
<SMALL CLASS=SMALL><PRE>&gt;@l me:grab
@program ~MooBoy:grab   any none none
 1:  &quot;The grab verb allows you to ``grab'' persons + objects in the same room&quot;;
 2:  &quot;as well as persons in other rooms&quot;;
 3:  &quot;All it really does is just displaying a random message to the other person&quot;;
 4:  &quot;&quot;;
 5:  &quot; ---- permission: only yourself can execute this verb&quot;;
 6:  if (caller != this)
 7:    player:tell(&quot;Sorry, you don't have permission to use this verb&quot;);
 8:    return;
 9:  endif
10:  &quot; ---- list of messages and random generation of one --- &quot;;
11:  messages = {&quot;.... maybe you really should start worrying a bit !&quot;,
 &quot;You feel that this might be the start of something really dangerous&quot;,
 &quot;You sense his virtual eyes on you!&quot;,
 &quot;.... maybe you should disconnect&quot;,
 &quot;Did you say good bye to your friends ?,
 you might just want to do that before it's too late!&quot;};
12:  message = messages[random(length(messages))];
13:  &quot; --- test if the object or person is in the same room&quot;;
14:  if (dobj == #-3)

         any object of that name in this room&quot;);
19:    else
