<h2>Draft 2</h2>

Advanced educational uses of computer networks: How can we design
and implement systems that support effective learning, for example, on
the Internet, and particularly on the WWW and in MUDs?  Areas covered:
Collaborative learning environments on the net; Using intelligent agents
over the Internet; Networked Human-Computer collaboration;
Interactive multiuser information systems.


<h2>Draft 3 (Paolo)</h2>

Advanced educational uses of computer networks.
How can we design and implement systems that support effective
learning? Covered areas include interactive shared environments,
resource-based learning and Human-Computer Collaboration; e.g.: MUDs,
WWW and agents on and over Internet.

<h2>Draft 4 (Jeni)</h2>

Advanced educational uses of the Internet.  How can we design and
implement systems that support effective learning? Covered areas
include resource-based learning (e.g. using the WWW), interactive
shared environments (e.g. IRC), and Human-Computer Collaboration
(e.g. MUDs)

<h2>Draft 5 (Daniel)</h2>

Advanced educational uses of the Internet.  How can we design and
implement networked systems that support effective learning? Covered
areas include (1) enhanced educational hypertext, (2) interactive
shared learning environments and (3) Human-Computer Collaboration. We
are particularly interested in WWW and MUD-based systems that include
"interactive", "collaborative", "intelligent", or "adaptive" features.

<h2>Draft 6 (Daniel/Paolo)</h2>

Advanced educational uses of the Internet.  How can we design and
implement effective networked systems? Target areas include (1)
enhanced educational hypertext, (2) interactive shared learning
environments and (3) human-computer collaboration. We are particularly
interested in WWW and MUD-based systems that include interactive,
collaborative and adaptive features; interface and information agents;
tutoring and "learning-by-doing" components.
