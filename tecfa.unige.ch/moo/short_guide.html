<H1>1. CLIENTS and CONNECTION</H1>

For Mooing there is quite a choice:

<h2> MOO Client Java Applets</h2>
See the <A HREF="connect-page.html">TecfaMOO Connection Page</A>.

<h2>"Real" MOO Clients</h2>
For more regular work you may want to download and install a "real" client.
See our short <A HREF="builders.html">Moo resource page</A>.

<H2>TecfaMOO's WWW interface</H2>

<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="rooms/photos/icons/i-lac1.jpg"
ALT="Lake View">NEW: <A HREF="http://tecfamoo.unige.ch:7000/">The
WWW-MOO Interface</A> is useful for people who don't like traditional
MOO clients and who want to focus on MOO interaction at some point.
(client eats up a whole screen)

<h2>Simple Telnet</h2>
Just to glance at TecfaMOO, you can use 
<A HREF="telnet://tecfamoo.unige.ch:7777">a telnet connection</A>,
note however that output will mix with your input on your screen.
 <P>

<H1>A VERY SHORT GUIDE TO MOOing</H1>

<P>
Here is some basic information on how to do the most basic actions in
a MOO. You can always type <em> 'help'</em> to get an index of help topics. To
get specific help about communication, for example, you can type 'help
communication'. (Alternatively you can <A HREF="http://tecfamoo.unige.ch:7777/help/introduction">access this information</A> via
our WWW/MOO gateway)
<P>
MOOs are organized around ``rooms'', i.e. you are always in some
location. So a first thing you need to learn is how to look at the
room you're in: Just type<em> 'look'</em>. To get information on the objects
around you, you can type<em> 'look <b>&lt;</b>object<b>&gt;</b>'</em>.
<P>
To communicate with people in the same room you're in, you can ``talk'' (use <STRONG>'say'</STRONG>)
to them by typing something like:
<P>
<PRE>   
   say Hello, there.
      - or -
   &quot;Hello, there
</PRE>
 <P>
In order to address yourself publicly to a person in the same room, use a "<STRONG>-</STRONG>" (dash), as in the following example:
<PRE>
   -Daniel what did you mean ?
   You say to Daniel, "what did you mean ?"
</PRE>
<P>
To know who else is connected at the time, type <em>'@who'</em>. You get also
information on where they are, for how long they have been connected,
and when they were active last. 
 <P>
To communicate with people not in your
room, you can <STRONG>'page'</STRONG> them like in the following example:
<P>
<PRE>
   page Jane Do you have some free time ?
            - or -
   'Jane Do you have some free time ?
</PRE>
<P>
If you want to go to another room, you can walk though an ``exit''
<em> by typing the exit's name</em>. Exits are normally listed when you 'look'
like in the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   &gt;look
   Daniel's Office
   You see open boxes, a desk and other brand new office furniture
   Obvious Exits: Atrium (to The Tecfa Atrium) and Tower (to Tower).
</PRE>
<P>
Finally, to log off, type <STRONG>'@quit'</STRONG>.
 <P>
Also note that in TecfaMOO most
"interesting" places are linked by the "Underground Corridor" (UC).
If you are lost, you can always type <STRONG>'home'</STRONG> which will bring you
back to the Arrival area.
 <P>
Registered users ONLY can use the <STRONG>'@join'</STRONG> command to join a person
as in the following example:
<PRE>
>@join daniel
You join Daniel.
</PRE>

<H2>Registration for a user name on TecfaMOO</H2>

Note that you can always login as 'guest' (no password required). However
guests do not have access to all features. In order to receive your
own character, please register ! Login first as 'guest' to tecfamoo.unige.ch 7777, then:
<UL>
<LI>Go to the registration room off the arrival area by typing 'register'
<LI>or type '@request' anywhere in the MOO.
