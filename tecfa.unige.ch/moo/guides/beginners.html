<P>
Here is some summary information on how to do the most basic actions in a<BR>
MOO. Note that there are lots of other commands; these are best learnt through<BR>
practice, by observing and asking other participants.<BR>
<P>
<h2>1. Getting basic information</h2>
<P>
You can always type 'help' to get an index of help topics. To get specific<BR>
help about communication, for example, you can type 'help <a href="http://tecfamoo.unige.ch:7777/help/communication">communication</a>'. <BR>
<P>
To find out what the room you're in looks like, just type 'look'. To get <BR>
information on the objects around you, you can:<BR>
<pre>
          look &lt;object&gt; <BR>
</pre>
'examine &lt;object&gt;' to get the description, and additional information, like<BR>
the owner of the object, and some commands to use it.<BR>
<P>
To know who else is connected at any time, type '@who'. You get also<BR>
information on where they are, for how long they have been connected, and<BR>
when they were active last. To communicate with people not in your room, you<BR>
can 'page' them (see below). Note people may be idling and/or be away from<BR>
their console.<BR>
<P>
<P>
<h2>2. Basic Navigation</h2>
See also: 'help <a href="http://tecfamoo.unige.ch:7777/help/movement">movement</a>')<BR>
<P>
Usually when you are in a location (called &quot;rooms&quot; in MOO terminology) exits<BR>
connecting to other rooms are listed. To go there just type the exit name,<BR>
e.g.:
<pre>
                 up
</pre>
To join a person, type:
<pre>
                @join &lt;name&gt;<BR>
</pre>
Note that is is usually polite to page a person and ask whether you can<BR>
join her.<BR>
<P>
To go to a remote place, type:<BR>
<pre>
                @go &lt;place&gt;<BR>
</pre>
both @join and @go use an algorithm that will walk you there if possible, <BR>
or teleport you directly.<BR>
<P>
<P>
<h2>3. Basic Communication</h2>
See also: 'help <a href="http://tecfamoo.unige.ch:7777/help/communication">communication</a>')<BR>
<P>
In the following examples, your character name is 'John'.  To communicate<BR>
with people in the same room you're in, you can talk, emote, whisper,<BR>
think and more:<BR>
<P>
3.1 Speaking<BR>
<Pre>
         say Hello, there.<BR>
         &quot;Hello, there <BR>
</Pre>
Those are equivalent methods for speaking. Visible to everyone in the same<BR>
room.  You see: You say, &quot;Hello, there.&quot;<BR>
<P>
3.2 To communicate with people not in your room, you can 'page' them:<BR>
<Pre>
          page Jane Do you have some free time?<BR>
          'Jane Do you have some free time? <BR>
</Pre>
3.3 Emoting:<BR>
<Pre>
           emote smiles.<BR>
           :smiles <BR>
</Pre>
Those are equivalent methods for 'emoting': expressing non-verbal<BR>
actions. visible to everyone in the  same room. <BR>
<Pre>
          You see: John smiles. <BR>
</pre>
3.4 Whispering:<BR>
<Pre>
          whisper &quot;Jane, I am bored&quot; to Jane <BR>
</Pre>
The message is only visible to Jane, but other people will see that you're <BR>
whispering to her.<BR>
<Pre>
   You see: You whisper, &quot;Hello, Jane darling&quot; to Jane. <BR>
</pre>
3.5 Thinking:<BR>
<Pre>
          think I think therefore I am. <BR>
</Pre>
Thinking is visible to everyone in the same room. <BR>
<Pre>
    You see: John . o O ( I think therefore I am ) <BR>
</Pre>
3.6 Directed speech:<BR>
<P>
Often when several people are in the same room, you may want to address a<BR>
particular person:<BR>
<Pre>
          -Jane I agree with you. <BR>
	  `Jane I agree with you.<BR>
      You see: You say to Jane, &quot;I agree with you.&quot;<BR>
      Jane sees: John says to you, &quot;I agree with you.&quot;<BR>
      Others see:  John says to Jane, &quot;I agree with you.&quot;<BR>
</Pre>
<P>
3.7 You can also page-emote: <BR>
<Pre>
           +Jane is shaking his head<BR>
</Pre>
   You see: &quot;Jane sees: John is shaking his head&quot;<BR>
<P>
<h2>4. Customizing</h2>
<P>
Usually when you get a character (or username) here, you will need to<BR>
customize your &quot;look&quot;:<BR>
<P>
Your description describes you &quot;visually&quot;<BR>
<Pre>
       @describe me as &quot;A tall person with a white beard&quot;<BR>
</Pre>
You also should set your gender to male or female (for pronoun substitution)<BR>
<Pre>
       @gender male<BR>
</Pre>
Structured information about yourself can be entered via the Web interface.<BR>
Just click on yourself and fill in the forms.<BR>
<P>
If you want to customize your office and/or build rooms and objects,<BR>
type 'help <a href="http://tecfamoo.unige.ch:7777/help/building">building</a>', in particular 'help <a href="http://tecfamoo.unige.ch:7777/help/creation">creation</a>'.<BR>
<P>
<h2>5. Other</h2>
<P>
To change your password: <BR>
<Pre>
      @password &lt;old password&gt; &lt;new password&gt; <BR>
</Pre>
If you have trouble with text running off your screen, or if you<BR>
receive only the beginning of the lines, you might try the following<BR>
commands:<BR>
<P>
