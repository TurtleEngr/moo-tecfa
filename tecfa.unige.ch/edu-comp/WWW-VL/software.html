The site is a resource for science educators and researchers to obtain 
samples of crossplatform, programmable virtual instruments (VIs).  The 
software (The Virtual Scientist) is a collection of LabVIEW (student 
edition compatable) libraries for many fields including physics, 
chemistry, biology, psychology, engineering, etc.).  The libraries are 
ready to use and will allow scientists and teachers to quickly replace 
traditional instruments with computer based instruments (better).  
Hardware is available (The Science ToolBox) to mate with the VIs for 
actual data collection on the desktop.

are still selling Buttons to many professionals and educators who simply can't get their trusted
DOS applications to run in Windows 3.1 or Windows 95"
