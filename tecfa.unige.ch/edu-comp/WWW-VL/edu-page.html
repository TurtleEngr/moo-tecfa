     Technology Review Home Page</A>
 Technology Review, edited at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
covers the beat of "technology  and its implications" and is unique in 
that it addresses the practical applications of science and in that it 
emphasizes policy issues rather than nuts and bolts. Avoiding gee-whiz 
oversimplification at the one extreme and excessive detail at the other, 
it is edited for sophisticated but general readers.
