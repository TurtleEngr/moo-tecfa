Maintained by <A HREF="http://tecfa.unige.ch/">TECFA</A>. Note:
haven't been hunting actively for the last few month, but will do that
soon. At least will add entries you send me. Also, need to reorganize
everything. Happy scrolling ! (D.S. / Jan 96). Still true in June 97 :=)
<P>
Since I will teach my VE course in May, I started cleaning up this mess (April 98).
If I have time I will reorganize the whole thing.
<STRONG>I really do have trouble with some people who think it's kewl to move
around files in their server. Please consider that most MOO indexes only get
updated once every 1-3 years or never at all and learn how to do redirections ! </STRONG>

This page is basically "MUD" oriented because (so far) that is
how educational interactive multi-user cyberspaces have been implemented.
That might change soon (e.g. see the section on
<a href="eduVR-page2.html#others">2/3D multi user virtual worlds</a>).
<P>
MUDs used to stand for "Multi-user Dungeons", i.e.  multi-user
interactive role-playing games on the Internet.  Today, the concept
"MUD" refers to all primarily text-based Multi-User Dimensions.  MUD
technology can be used for education in various ways. To connect to a
MUD, you can use a telnet client, but better find a specialized <a href="eduVR-page2.html#Clients">Client</a> In education, MOOs (MUD, Object Oriented)
are most popular since they have a sophisticated built-in programming
language. See also <A HREF="http://tecfa.unige.ch/guides/MOO/ProgMan/ProgrammersManual_1.html">a definition</A> by Pavel Curtis.
The absolut best distinction between "MUD" and "MOO" I have seen
is in <A HREF="http://foner.www.media.mit.edu/people/foner/Julia/muds.html">this picture</A>.
 <P>
MUDs (and specially the MOO variant) can be be characterized by:

<UL>
<LI>Many persons can connect simultaneously to a server.
<LI>The MUD has a spatial organization, e.g. people interact with people
or objects primarily within "rooms".
<LI>Within a MOO, many real time communication actions exist, like "saying"
or "emoting" things publically to the persons in a "room", paging people
elsewhere, "whispering" messages, using a "CB" channel, etc.
<LI>Asynchronous communication tools include internal e-mail, Newsgroups,
News papers, tutorial rooms, "white boards", etc.
</UL>


Watch out for new systems and increased functionality of 2/3D "Avatar"/Chat
worlds and VRML interfaces to real MUDs in the next month.

expertise, ideas, and resources that no one organization could provideby 
itself.  Most of all, TAPPED IN is a professional community of K-12 TPD 
providers, schools, teachers, and researchers committed to education 
reform. Although each organization has its own mission, all contribute to 
the sustenance and growth of the community by committing time and 
resources and by helping to underwrite the costs of teacher participation 
and TAPPED IN capabilities and services. Individual teachers contribute 
to the community by participating in activities, helping others, and

 This section needs to be further developed .... in the mean time teachers
should go and visit and ask around.
Most educational text-based VR seems to use MOOs. Among the wider spread
MUD architectures MOOs are probably best suited because of the pretty
powerful MOO programming language.

Not much about MUD/MOOs seems to available in published form. In any

<LI>Check out larger educational MOOs for teachers' guidelines 
<LI>One of the problems with MUD/MOO teaching is to give some basic MOO
training to your students. Most educational MOO-WWW pages do have some materials, e.g.
see the ones in the <A HREF="http://www.du.org/places/du/cybercomp.html">Composition in Cyberspace</A> page or look at the
<A HREF="http://www.ucet.ufl.edu/writing/MOO/">Mooville</A> page.
<LI>For general technical information, check out the rest of this page. E.g. consult
the various <a href="eduVR-page2.html#Guides">MOO/MUD Guides, FAQs &amp; Manuals</a>.
If you want to start up your own server it is best to get some experience else{MOO/MUD/etc} first.

if you plan to do work within a MOO !
<LI><A HREF="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Amy.Bruckman/MacMOOSE/">MacMOOSE</A>
MacMOOSE is a client program designed to make it easier to program MOOs and MOOSEs, and includes: Object browsers, WYSIWYG (editing) and more !
<LI><A HREF="http://www.microserve.net:80/~server/mudwin/">MudWin</A>:
A simple Windows Client. This client works at our site with FTP Inc's TCP/IP
software. The only DOS/Windows client which does that so far (Jan 95).
No local editing, pretty useless for development. There are lots of other clients
like this.
<LI>MUDDweller is simple Mac client that works will with Mac TCP/IP.
Ftp Archives: <A HREF="ftp://rudolf.ethz.ch/pub/mud">here</A> or

No local editing, pretty useless for development.

 <LI>Emacs rmoo client</A> (the original link has been dead for years, but
we still got a copy <A HREF="ftp://tecfa.unige.ch/pub/software/unix/mud-clients/">in our FTP archive</A>. Works with GNU Emacs (also with Xemacs if you adapt it).
In our opinion the best overall
emacs MOO client (since programming support is good). You can forget about @notedit,
just remember to type '@edito +l' (@editoptions +local), this was not obvious to me
when I started Mooing! 
<LI><A HREF="ftp://muds.okstate.edu/pub/jds/clients/UnixClients/mud.el">mud.el</A>. An
other emacs client, simpler than rmoo but easier to install maybe. A number of improved

THIS SECTION BADLY NEEDS UPDATING / sometimes soon - DKS Nov 96

A number of 2/3D virtual worlds have come into existence lately. Some
are extensions to VRML, some really proprietary. Judging from the time
it takes to look at their www pages, those things will be popular enough.
<P>
This section is not very complete. It's a real pain updating commercial links
every few month.

<LI><A HREF="http://www.ichat.com/">Ichat</A>
Quote: "chat (pronounced I - chat) was founded to expand the functionality and uses of real-time chat
systems on the Internet. First, through the ichat client which makes access to existing Internet chat
systems easy by providing an integrated access tool with an easy to use graphical user interface.
And through the ichat server, which makes it possible to run a real-time chat server and to
integrate it with a World Wide Web site."

<LI><A HREF="http://discover-net.net/~hljmm/gmuds.html">Intel</A> had something that now seems to be dead, here is a quote:
 "Moondo is a Windows* application that lets you visit 3D
multi-user virtual worlds and create your own virtual worlds for
others to visit. Moondo features VRML rooms and avatars, audio chat,
personally-created avatars, multiple views of the virtual world, and
URL-based browsing of distributed Moondo servers world-wide".

<LI><A HREF="http://www.thepalace.com/">The Palace</A> - Certainly the
biggest 2D server vendor (standard clients are free). It's well working technology
and a 3-user version is free for trials.
Quote: "The Palace is an Internet-based multimedia chat architecture,
kind of a cross between IRC and hypercard yet completely unique in
many respects. You can author and run your own social online
environment on your server, and visit other people's servers. The
architecture is fast, extensible through a scripting language, and can
visually look like anything you want! Because there are servers
distributed across the Internet (like the Web), there is no single
central authority and the load is distributed."

<LI><A HREF="http://www.worldsaway.ossi.com/Worldsaway/away1.html">Worlds Away</A> (bloody dead link) -

Quotes: "Combining the social dimension of chat services with the
graphic dimension of multiplayer games, WorldsAway allows thousands of
CompuServe members in the U.S., Europe, Japan and 150 countries
worldwide, to meet, interact and join together in building a virtual
community. [...]
WorldsAway users can create and control their own on-line animated
identities -- called avatars -- and take part in a variety of in-world
events and activities. [...]
WorldsAway is built on a distributed object-oriented technology which
allows for a limitless addition of both users and WorldsAway regions.

Quotes: "
Virtual Places is an architecture for a world-wide cyberspace. This cyberspace consists of shared
spaces distributed over the Internet. In these shared spaces, information and people come together" ... The Virtual Places family of products transforms any Internet data server, such as the World Wide
Web (WWW), from a static repository of information to a network of shared interactive spaces.
This means that Web pages, and other Universal Resource Locators (URLs), become addressable,
persistent, and inhabitable locations where people can meet, share content, and communicate in
real time via voice or text."

Please have a look at my <A HREF="http://tecfa.unige.ch/guides/vrml/pointers.html">VRML pointers page</A>.

<LI><STRONG>VRML/MOO extensions</STRONG>:
In order to integrate VRML &amp; MOO there
are probably several solutions. Addresses again the lack of the "MOO to
Client protocol" problem we have with our html and "smart" client interfaces.
Benefits for educational MOOs might be increased attractiveness (not so important) and use of VRML data structures that profit from 3D (chemistry, cooperative castle design, teaching sculpture on-line....).
<P>
... got to hunt down pointers ! .. again, help me please.

<LI>BioMOO's "add-on": Quote from Erice Mercer: "If you have a
reasonably sophisticated browser (like Netscape with the WebFX
plug-in) you can quickly switch between VRML and web views of a room.
All VRML scenes are generated on the fly, reflecting real conditions
in the MOO. Objects can be given VRML shapes by users, else they
appear as simple geometric shapes.<br> This VRML system was built by
me on top of the BioWeb system for MOOs that Gustavo Glusman, Jaime
Prilusky, Paul Hansen and I wrote.  We're modifying it now to
incorporate the wonderful enhancements of 1.8.0 but it should be
available soon. Don't bother writing because we'll announce it here
[in the MOO Cows list] first.  At that time you can figure out how it
works for yourself by getting the package.  It's designed to be easily
installed in any preexisting MOO."
<LI>At some point MOOndo (see above) was supposed to that, but then it did not.
<LI><A HREF="http://bug.village.virginia.edu/">WAX Web</A>.
Edited Quote from <A HREF="http://tecfa.unige.ch/edu-comp/WWW-VL/%3Chttp://www.cs.brown.edu/people/twm/%3E">Tom Meyer: </A>
I've been running a MOO [..] outputing VRML for about a
year now (Waxweb, first web server of any
kind to be serving up VRML), [...] but have
not been that pleased by how suitable MOO is for VRML.
I now generate VRML files on the fly from an http-speaking MOO server.
Before I added in VRML support, the server worked quite well.  Since
the VRML files are roughly ten times larger than the HTML files that
describe the room, that caused enormous slow-downs in the MOO. [..]
I'm very interested in combining the ideas in MOOs and VRML, but feel
that generating VRML on the fly in an interpreted language doesn't
scale very well, especially when the OODB that's generating it was
designed for small, rapid (interactive) updates."
