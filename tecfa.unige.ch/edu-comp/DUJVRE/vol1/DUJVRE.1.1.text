        DIVERSTIY UNIVERSITY WELCOME MESSAGE

Welcome to the Diversity University Journal of Virtual Reality
Education(DUJVRE)!  I can't tell you how excited I am about Donald
actually making this happen since it's been in my dreams ever since
Diversity University(DU) was started.

All of us who work on educational M**s(MOOs or MUDs, two types of
real time text based conferencing systems) are painfully familiar
with the accusatory phrase, hurled at us by some people that says,
"M**s are just games! Dungeons and Dragons, with no redeeming value.".
This journal will help dispell that myth.

The DUJVRE will be a scholarly refereed journal which will present
articles, research, observations, insights and dreams regarding the
provision of education of all kinds via a VR environment.  Currently,
we are primarily looking at the text-based environment called a MUD
but do not intend to limit ourselves to this type. DUJVRE will provide
information about other projects going on in this field thus bringing
us all closer together and will allow individuals working on similar
or parallel projects to collaborate if they wish.  DUJVRE also will
contain articles on how this medium impacts on individuals.

In future editions you will read how DU and other MUDs are being
redesigned in sometimes apparently invisible ways to better serve
people with disabilities and by people you might never expect. You
will be touched as I was by Samantha's article "How I lost 20 pounds
on the New MOO Diet", an account of how the ability of the MUD
environment to provide accomodation had a vital impact on the physical
life of a person.  Dr. Zenhausern's article in this issue sheds
considerable light on a disability that many of use who swear by
computers may even have and not realize.  Computers can be used as
assistive devices in more ways than most of us realize.

As within any academic community, there are differences between the
approaches of individual VR educators.  Our journal intends to include
as many of these as possible.  I hope we can focus on matching the
approach to the medium, subject or learning style rather than
declaring any one approach to be "the" solution. The variety of
learning styles I have encountered only serves to reinforce my belief
that there is no best approach to teaching or learning, only the best
way to teach this subject to this learner.  In December I was
privileged to attend a gathering of individuals in Boston who are also
working towards using MUDs in education.  The purpose of the MUDshop,
as it was called, was to bring together as a community, people who
have been working, up to this point, in isolation from each other.
It was interesting to note that of the many people the committee
members recommended to attend, that only Pavel Curtis was mentioned by
more than one person.  One thing that became crystal clear at this
ARPA-sponsored workshop was the desperate need for statistical support
for what we are doing.  To generate valid  and reliable data, research
must be replicated and this is one reason to bring this community
together.  It is our hope that this journal will be one way to do that.

        Danford  facrept@nccvax.wvnet.edu                     6

        Teaching Microbiology at Diversity University

Danford, Professor of Biology at West Virginia Northern Community
College has been teaching his introductory microbiology course at DU
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  This class which meets 4 fours per week
has been averaging 2 hours per week at the MOO.   Danford has included
DU based activities as course requirements.  He is also using a vax
Notes Conference to facilitate discussion of current topics.

Danford is combining traditional classroom lecture approach with
constructivist technology enhanced activities in this course.  The
constructivist assignments include a student microscope slide set, an
instructional object of some sort, and participation in a group
project.  The group projects are separate rooms, each devoted to a
specific disease or pathogen.  Students were divided into three
member groups and the disease/organism was assigned in the beginning
of the semester.  At the end of the term, each group will present its
room and contents to the class.

Danford's online classtime is usually spent in a variety of
activities.  Usually he posts the assignments on a generic notice
board so that students can progress at their own rate and in their own
order.  For an hour's time at DU, he would post 3 or 4 chores.  There
would be some information gathering and analysis, usually by use of an
@detailed object (his favorite) or an individually  programmed object;
next there could be one of two types of collaborative activities -
either topic or group related; and finally he would pose a question or
questions that students are expected to answer before leaving the class.

Danford said, "What surprised me the most about integrating DU into my
course was the reaction of the students.  They were captivated and
motivated by DU.  A couple of weeks into the course, I asked on the
Vax Notes Conference if learning microbiology could be fun.  The
responses were overwhelmingly positive.  I can assure you that very
few traditional microbiology students would evaluate their course as
'fun'."  Danford continued, "The next real surprise to me was a hidden
asset to MOO based learning:  the attention to detail.  Students
quickly learn that precise typing and precise attention to details are
a necessity.  This teaches the skills of observation, organization,
and persistence (as in follow through).  These skills are sometimes
hard to incorporate into traditional lecture environments but come
as part of the package with DU. "

To quote from the course syllabus: In addition to the traditional
microbiology course objectives, this section will also:
  1. introduce the student to electronic communication and information
     storage/retrieval (EMail, VaxNotes, Internet, DU-MOO).
  2. encourage the students to develop skills applicable to technology,
     electronic communication, and information storage/retrieval.
  3. emphasize the development of student critical thinking and
     writing skills in the study of microbiology (applicable to all
     other disciplines and life too).
  4. explore some of the moral and ethical questions facing students
     in the health sciences in the context of our global community.







        Danford  facrept@nccvax.wvnet.edu                     7

Danford's classroom, named Micro Lab, #4668, is open to the public
whenever a class is not meeting there.  There are a number of
informational objects available including: Prokaryote, Antibiotics,
Antigen, Antibody, Antigen-antibody Reactions, HIV, HIV Disease
Spectrum, Bacteriophage, Notifiable Diseases, Metabolism, and
Virulence.  There are also some programmed objects:
Streak_Plate (inoculate), _Streptomyces_fradiae_(grow), a basket of
condoms (take condom).

In future articles Danford indicated that he would write about the
vax Notes Conference and about further MOO teaching experiences.

Subject:      Towards Ordinary Teaching at Diversity University

        Towards Ordinary Teaching at DU

Abstract: Transforming a text based virtual reality conferencing
system, i.e., a MOO, into an ordinary teaching environment.
In the near future more and more classes will go online, a case
is made for using MOOs as teaching environments. A tour of U. Can,
a small virtual school, shows what can be done at DU MOO.

               I) CLASSROOM OBSERVATIONS

WHAT DOES A TYPICAL MOO STUDENT EXPERIENCE?:
Non-virtual or real class experiences are very subjective and MOO ones
are also. The discussions before and after classes are both revealing
and informative. At first there is MOO consciousness as beginners,
called newbies, adjust to the virtual environment. Newbies often feel
they are in a strange country where the buildings and streets are not
familiar. Usually veterans explain to the newer participants how to
communicate on the MOO. This is a bit like pre-college orientation
meetings. Once these communications basics are mastered, the dialog
typically turns to personal questions or general everyday topics.
By the end of the course, the conversations become quite comfortable,
resembling ordinary ones.

MOO CLASSES ARE NO LONGER EXPERIMENTAL:
MOO classes do work!  As teachers gain experience in this environment,
they can spend less time discussing teaching and more time doing it.
Usually participants just need basic MOO orientation. The amount
depends on the person's experience and the level of competence required.

CURRENT TEACHING TOOLS:
(MOO terms used are descriptive but to really understand what the text
based tools do  try them)
The use of teaching tools is very subjective and depends on the
instructor. These include using 'lecture notes', 'slide shows',
'notice boards' and 'Television tapes' [see Ken's article].
Chalk is still the basic tool in many classrooms; the MOO
equivalent is direct typing using a keyboard. The classrooms
and meeting rooms developed by Ken and others allow varying
degrees of control including moderated discussion. Courtesy and common
sense allow any place to be used as a classroom. However, a clock,
blackboard, tables and chairs are useful props.  They add a perception
of learning environment in real life and in a MOO.

POSITIVE ASPECTS OF MOO:
The advantages of MOO over postal mail and email should be obvious.
Spontaneity and real time interaction provides a rich learning
experience. For people located in isolated areas this provides
a sense of community. If you believe in learning from others,
then MOO provides an opportunity to do that at great distances
even across international boundaries. As with any education, it
is an opportunity that must be seized.




        Donald  idd@io.org                                     9

               II) CONDUCTING CLASSES AT DU

POSSIBLE NOW AT DU:
People taking classes at DU have access to MOO objects there.
A 'notebook','notice board', 'gopher slate',and 'WWW slate'
are MOO versions of pencil, paper and laptop computer. How
many regular classrooms give every student access to Gopher
and the World Wide Web?  DU can do it now.

MOO WARNINGS AND SUGGESTIONS:
Prospective teachers should first master a few MOO basics before
attempting to teach on a MOO. If this is not possible then having
an experienced assistant is recommended. Know your environment;
expect 'LAG'!  Lag is 'network' delay between typing something seeing
it. If lag is big, you and/or students are essentially disconnected.
Try to minimize excessive text on screen which is very distracting
especially for beginners. Use notice board(DU) like MOO objects.
These are wonderful text projectors for group viewing and text can
also be reviewed, by those who are late or are just recovering from
a brief amount of LAG, without disturbing class presentation flow.
This partial solution was designed to reduce minor asynchonous
'lag' problems which are still prevalent on the internet.

Teaching tool selection is very subjective and depends on the
individual. Some will prefer a line by line presentation using
straight typing from a keyboard. Others will want to use a
'Lecture' (#6140 at DU) which allows lines of text to be entered
and recalled by number(DU is an Object Oriented world, numbers
#nnnn are DU objects). There are various MOO objects like the
'Notice board' (#5266 at DU) and 'Slide show' (#1650 at DU) which
show a block of text all at once. There are also presentations which
allow entered lines to appear on a time delayed basis (TV #907 at DU).


HOW TO HOLD A COURSE (A Simple Teaching Guide):
The following are simple steps for holding MOO classes.
1. As with any course prepare an outline and fill it in.
2. Get approvals so space, time, etc. fixed and covered.
3. Place a few advertisements in appropriate places.
4. Answer email personally, 'Pine' mailer does list also.
5. Send materials, get them online and through orientation.
6. Present and discuss materials, and do it your way.
7. Learn from the class and rethink the next one.




        Donald  idd@io.org                                    10

                  III) THE FUTURE

COMING THIS NEXT YEAR:
There are several new extensions of MOO being tested that include
graphics. BioMOO has been working on a World Wide Web(WWW) programming
interface. Others also been working on a WWW interface include
Sensemedia's World MOO. WWW capabilities include graphics, sound,
and multimedia as well as text. Independent of these WWW extensions
is the extension that almost every MOO user is waiting to hear about.
Pavel Curtis at Xerox will release 'Jupiter' which is apparently more
of a 'whiteboard' product. Users with special Jupiter client programs,
either X-windows or Microsoft Windows for now, can use special graphics
MOO objects. These objects will generate a window on the user's
graphics screen.  Graphic icons and a mouse are available to draw
simple lines, etc. even color even. A properly equipped local area
network will allow images and sound locally. These will be described
in a future article.


FUTURE BY LINEAR EXTRAPOLATION.
In 2001, $1,000 buys a laptop Silicon Graphics Workstation and
you have change left over for a 28.8K clunker modem. Ordinary phones
use 56K modems that cost less than $100. The Internet is world
wide and you can talk to it through a small pocket computer and output
shows up on your glasses. VR is almost affordable. Using high resolution
stereographic glasses, gloves and a few body gloves people will be able to
alter their virtual environments. Education can be done locally
connecting to Universities located throughout the world. People will
consult their computers. Almost everyone will have gigabytes of info:
books, files etc. with them or available instantly through the 'skye-net'
everywhere. People will be able to choose either information or
entertainment. Most will choose entertainment. The remaining people
will have incredible access to information and information services
takes on new meanings.

             IV) A TOUR OF U CAN

U CAN:
U Can was founded to deliver quality affordable classes using
self selection principles with a 'you can do' attitude.
Current development projects include 'Snowflake' involving
DU MOO, Donut MOO, and BayMOO. This will be shown later.

U Can is in Diversity University's 'Business School'. It's north of
'Cratchet Hall 3-4' or type '@go #5029' from anywhere in DU.





        Donald  idd@io.org                                    11

#5029 is the U Can lounge, it centers a small complex of linked rooms.
There is something in almost every direction:
* North is 'Future parc' a residential area where students store things.
* South is 'Cratchet Hall 3-4' of the 'DU Business School'.
* East is 'WakeMOO', here michael holds Finnegan's Wake(Joyce) meetings.
* West leads to the Internet classroom where Internet classes are held.
* Down leads to 'UCCC' a new area where computer classes will be held.
* Up leads to 'MOOland' a development planned for near future.

UCCC:
Unix classes and Tutorials will be held and stored here, along
with HTML classes and tutorials in both English and Spanish.

MOOland:
An educational 'exposition' area with self paced learning and real
time guidance. In particular 'Snowflake' tutorial project will be
undertaken jointly with several MOOs: BayMOO, Donut, and DU.

UCAN TOUR:
The following are some screen captures of an online session at DU.
The text scrolls onto the screen as one moves from room to room
using mostly standard directions: N, S, E, W, Up and Down.
The text is what a person who 'enters' the room would see on screen.

NOTE:Screen captures are shown between dashed lines and are numbered.

A brief note on current U Can activites:
Initially DaveM conceived of his notice board to save quota and
to present stories to children.  After many requests from various
people he adapted it to the needs of teachers at DU. This latest
reincarnation is an easy to use tutorial room aimed at K-12 users.
With this accomplished MOOland and U Can are starting to evolve and
develop rapidly.  The next step is hypertext.  Working with DaveM
has been very enlightening and satisfying; things really move.

That ends the Tour of U Can.

        TEACHING AND LEARNING AT DIVERSITY UNIVERSITY

 Doing the Cha-Cha

   The Grand Plan

Students majoring in Communication Disorders at Marshall University
are required to take 6 credit hours in the area of Audiology and Aural
Rehabilitation.  This is typically done at the senior level, although
additional coursework is offered at the graduate level.  I teach the
basic audiology course, which requires that students master the basic
concepts of acoustics, the anatomy and physiology of the auditory
system, and the basic test battery.  While the first two areas can
effectively and efficiently be taught in a traditional college course
format, the basic test battery can only be conceptualized.  True
learning can only take place with actual practice with the process of
administering the basic test battery and screening protocol.


Clinical practicum opportunities in the area of audiology are
typically reserved for graduate students.  In addition, there is a
limited amount of equipment available for use in either practice
sessions or service provision.  These two factors prohibit students
in the basic audiology course from having sufficient opportunities to
practice and develop their skills in the process of administering the
basic test battery and screening protocol.  In an effort to answer
this dilemma, I created a virtual audiology lab to provide students
with ample opportunities for practice.  It is in this virtual
environment that students do not suffer from the typical real time
deficiencies (lack of access to equipment and lack of patients).


   The Cha-Cha

Readers who are familiar with the cha-cha may quickly catch on to my
analogy.  For those readers who spend more time on their computer
than on a dance floor, let me enlighten you about the analogy I have
chosen to use to describe my experiences thus far.

The Cha-Cha is a Brazilian dance.  Described simply, it's one step
forward and two steps back.  For my first step forward I spent hours
learning to program and completing the audiology lab to my
satisfaction. Eagerly I awaited the start of the Fall 1993 semester to
unveil my efforts to my students.  Within the first week of classes I
took my first step back.  Not a single student in a class of thirty
had an account on the university's computer system and only one out of
the thirty had any experience with a personal computer.  My second
step back came shortly thereafter when my colleagues could only feign
an interest since (1) only one other faculty member is an audiologist
and would be capable of truly appreciating the potential of the
virtual audiology lab, and (2) only one other faculty member (at that
time) utilized the university's access to the internet.


        Karen L. McComas  mccomas@marshall.edu                18

   Taking Dance Lessons

Encouraged by other individuals striving to use the virtual
environment to facilitate teaching and learning, I adjusted my
objectives and set my sights on taking another step forward.  First of
all, I offered bonus points to any student who sent e-mail to me and
asked for the bonus points.  [Fortunately for me, students will do
just about anything for bonus points and not until the end of the
semester did they realize that if everyone completed the task there
really wasn't much of a bonus involved.]  While their simple e-mail
message was most certainly a step forward, in most cases it was
followed immediately by two steps back since only a few students
logged in more than one time throughout the semester.

In the meantime, I began planning for my spring courses with an eye
to the development of computer literacy skills in my students.  Since
I would have the same students that had fallen for the bonus point
scam in the spring course, I had to be more creative and devious the
second time around.  This time, I utilized another area which I felt
certain  would motivate students.

Throughout my teaching, I have always made every attempt to answer
any question, any time, that a student may have regarding the material
being covered in class.  I have freely offered class time, prior to an
exam, for review and even accepted phone calls at home the night
before a test or the night before an assignment was due.  I decided
to continue that practice with a slightly different twist.

First, I eliminated  the use of a class period for exam review.  My
previous experiences had led me to the conclusion that what students
really wanted from this period of time was either (1) the questions
(or preferably) the answers or (2) all of the previous lectures given
again.  I offered, instead, to conduct the review on-line, on the
weekend before the exam.

The second change that I made had to do with those questions that
students ask, the ones when they stop you as you are about to enter
the bathroom or are trying to get to another class.  I suggested to
them that when they asked their questions in that manner, I was doing
them an injustice trying to provide a quick answer without giving
thoughtful consideration to the question.  I asked them to send their
questions to me via e-mail.  That way I could devote the necessary
time to considering their question and composing an answer that would
do justice to the subject matter.  The questions and answers could
then be distributed to all members of the class (via a mailing list
on the local mail program).  In addition, when someone asked the same
question for the tenth time, I could tell them that I had responded to
that question and they could pick up the response via e-mail.


        Karen L. McComas  mccomas@marshall.edu                19

Only one student routinely sent messages.  I suspect that she was the
only student who ever received the responses.  In spite of this
limited success, I knew that I had at least one student who had
learned a different dance.  Not only did she send e-mail relative to
the course, she sent e-mail asking questions about different features
available on the computer system, general messages just to make
contact, and during a particularly stressful time of the semester for
both students and myself, she sent a supportive note recognizing in
it that she felt that students didn't realize how much we [teachers]
actually did for them and that they tended to forget to thank us
[teachers].   While I was highly encouraged by her success, my virtual
audiology lab was getting dusty.


   A New Dance Begins

In the middle of the spring semester, I was offered a unique
opportunity.  For some unknown reason, our department had extra funds
for summer school and my department chair asked me if I would like to
offer a computer course.  Immediately I responded in the affirmative,
but I had to guarantee that the course would fill.  I developed some
devious plans to ensure that the course would fill (at least through
the census date) if I couldn't get it filled with our students.  As
the registration process began, I had committments from several
students, but few registrations.  As the spring semester ended, I was
close, but still not full.  I made flyers and recruited for the class
everywhere I went (including the softball field where my daughter
plays on a Little League team).


On the first day of class, I took another step forward.  With an
enrollment of sixteen (I only needed 9), the course began.  By all
accounts, the course was a success.  For me personally, the major
success came as a result of the three students that continued to
connect to MOO's even after the MOO assignment was completed.
Currently there are about thirty students in the program that
regularly utilize the computer resources available.  Within a year,
we have moved from no students participating in the traffic on the
internet to thirty travellers.


        Karen L. McComas  mccomas@marshall.edu                20

It's possible that we are no longer doing the cha-cha here at
Marshall.  The computer course was such a success that the faculty
included a recommendation in our curriculum review that the course be
developed as a regular offering to fulfill the computer literacy
requirement for graduation.  Each semester we have made gains in
connecting students to the value of the internet.  This semester
Marshall opened a World Wide Web server and student papers are being
"published" on the web.  This has heightened their interest and
encouraged several to start utilizing the resources available even
when they don't get bonus points.  As student awareness grows, and
the computer course is offered again in the spring, I plan to make
participation at Diveristy University a course requirement for next
fall.  In the meantime, I'll have to think of a clever name for a new
dance.

A Virtual Programming Course Using the MOO
******************************************

---------------------------

ABSTRACT
~~~~~~~~

The successful running of a fully virtual programming course using
three internet tools, World-Wide Web, Email and MOO, is reported. The
use of the MOO for realtime interaction of students and teachers is
particularly emphasized. Setup, running and experiences made with the
MOO during classes are explained and investigated. In May 1994 the
Globewide Network Academy (GNA [1]), a consortium of online schools,
organized its first fully virtual course "Introduction to
Object-Oriented Programming Using C++", an introductory course for the
C++ programming language. With 80 students and 10 consultants, it was
successfully completed by August 1994, with all interactions taking
place on the internet. At the 1st World- Wide Web conference in May
1994, Geneva, this course won the award for "Best Educational Service
on the Web '94" [2].

1. COURSE SETUP.
================

During the course, a global network document retrieval system called
the World - Wide Web [3] was the central static information
resource. Electronic mail, archived on the Web, was also used,
allowing for remote discussion between students and teachers. However,
the essential real-time environment to create a classroom atmosphere
for the students was a MOO, a multi-user environment with limited
programming capabilities using the Object-Oriented MOO language.

For the first course, all online sessions were held on Diversity
University (DU [4]), a MOO founded by Jeanne Butler McWhorter, who is
also a director of her own classroom, "The C++ Class", with the
visionary object-number #2000 (see fig. 1). The classroom was an
edited version of the standard classroom on DU, written by Ken
Schweller. For the C++ course, this room was luxuriously equipped with
additional help commands which would guide the MOO beginners through
their first sessions. Fig. 2 shows a list of these commands, presented
to any user who invoked the command "classhelp".

[Fig. 1: Description of the C++ classroom.]
----------------------------------------------------------------------

With the standard room commands "@un/authorize", all course
consultants were added to the list of authorized classroom
personnel. This enables them to change most of the interesting room
properties: with the "@sign on/off" command, they could make the
status of the class visible as "on" or "off " in the informational
"@who" list available to all MOO users. During sessions, entrance to
the room could be enabled/disabled through the " door open/close"
command: with the door "closed", only registered students and
authorized persons were allowed to enter. Unlike other rooms, failed
attempts to enter did not send a message to all session participants,
so class could remain undisturbed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Besides the standard setup, the room was equipped with a clock showing
local MOO time as well as GMT. In addition, a "US-clock" was made
available with the help commands displaying a map of the USA with its
time zones and GMT (see fig. 3). Desks and tables could be set up by
authorized players at leisure. By default, every session was recorded
using a MOO recorder. Recorder, tapes and clock were hidden from
direct view by storing them in a virtual "shelf" and a virtual "wall"
in order not to overload the room with details.  Furthermore, two
bulletin boards, labelled "for public posting" (by everyone in the
room) were set up in the room: one was meant for general announcements
by course consultants, the other was for notes and announcements about
course-related programming projects which involved only a smaller
number of all registered students.

2. GETTING STARTED & RUNNING MOO CLASSES .
===========================================

To solve the problem of registration for a greater number of temporary
users during the course duration, the "Visiting Student Player Object"
(VSPO, object #1939 on DU) was used.  This object class gives one or
more owners wizard-like control over a fixed set of accounts.
Passwords, player privileges and quota can be changed at request. The
wizards are automatically notified of changes applied to a particular
player of the VSPO. A fixed expiration date for the whole class is
optional. To begin with, the total of 80 player accounts was
distributed between two managing consultants. To actually become a
player, the students were asked to login as guest users first during
scheduled sessions where they would receive their password and user
identity. For this experimental course, security was not an issue,
which is why the consultants chose a method that also included a first
real-time interaction with new students. As their first action,
students were asked to change their password and set their
self-description. Besides getting informed about basic MOO commands
through a single info page, a TV for Ken Schweller's short MOO
programming course was set up in another room. Though the default
student only had the privileges of a "player", many of them
subsequently used the chance to take a deeper look into MOO
programming and wanted to receive "builder" and even "programmer"
privileges.

Before the course, most students had not used a MOO. They usually
logged on with the simple "telnet" command, devoid of any more
sophisticated client. To help with this, an FTP directory of common
clients was created [5] and other more experienced MOO players helped
writing short descriptions for each client. One consultant, Peter
Murray-Rust, even wrote a prototype X-based client using the tk/tcl
meta-language and offered it to the students [6]. Lots of additional
material could be accessed by the students and the greater public
through the Web pages, including classroom descriptions and sample
sessions. Parts of these texts could successfully be re-used for
another GNA course on the use of the internet.

There were no lectures in class during this course, but consultants
were available during fixed hours. The schedule, available on the MOO
as well as on the Web, covered up to three sessions of two hours each
every day of the week. In addition, the consultants held a public
meeting every Sunday to plan the following week. Transcripts of
interesting discussions were turned into hypertext using Laura
Pearlman's converter tool [7] and made available on the Web pages to
become a dynamical part of the whole hypertextbook.



Marcus Speh  marcus@andersen.co.uk                            25

About 80% of the students used the offer to meet and question
consultants on the MOO at least once. However, not more than 30% of
them became regular visitors during the course.  Consequently, some
consultants decided to switch to "sessions on demand" - if a student
wanted advice, he or she had to notify the consultant via MOOmail or
email to come to the classroom. Since the consultants were kept busy
preparing the hypertextbook and Web material and carrying out various
administrative tasks, too little time remained to further explore all
the possibilities of the MOO for this first programming course. In
general, the time needed to prepare students for MOO interaction and
guide them during their first days was underestimated. Also, threaded
email discussions were a strong competitor for the MOO sessions which
constituted the most experimental part of this prototype course.

3. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK.
========================

In spite of many shortcomings during this first course, the overall
opinion of most students and consultants was that the MOO is a very
promising resource. For a programming course trying to teach a
relatively complex language such as C++, graphical help would be
greatly appreciated. Both WWW and a gopher slate - which, in
principle, would have made it possible to paste short programs to the
MOO - were available, but not much used. Linking the MOO to the Web
would avoid duplication of material and save MOO database space, and
ongoing work of GNA people in this area will benefit future courses
[8]. Most certainly, it will pay to have a subgroup of the consultants
dedicated to MOO coursework, and similarly for WWW and Email
interaction. By the same token, one cannot expect 100% enthusiasm for
each part of this hybrid approach to online teaching. Since the
present diverse structure of the student audience is undoubtedly here
to stay, we will have to be diverse in the methods we can offer as
well. The MOO is one with a great potential that has only barely been
scratched.  It's full capababilities can only be realised through
using it to teach many courses to many students.

Results of the course and evaluations have been written up in various
papers by the author of the present article, Sandra Burke, Daniel
Perron and Tina Pitt. They are (or will be) available via FTP [2].

The purpose of this article is two-fold.  To illustrate the kind of
discrimination faced by the Learning Disabled child or adult in our
society and to summarize some of the strategies and techniques that
are currently in use with this group, with an emphasis on Education
in the 21st Century.


The Nature of the Problem

In our culture, there is an underlying bias against all types of
cognitive disabilities that does not exist for those with sensory
disabilities.  The student who is blind is not blamed for being blind,
but learning disability is somehow seen as the fault of the student.
The child with learning disabilities is often accused of inattention
or not working hard enough. The victim is held responsible for the
problem and all would be well if he or she would "try harder".

On the other hand, no one says to a blind person, "If you try harder
you will be able to see." In the case of sensory and physical
disability, we make accommodations in recognition of the specific
disability and provide alternatives approaches.  We recognize the
limitation imposed by the disability and teach them to reach the same
goals as the non-handicapped using alternative approaches, e.g.
Talking Books, Closed Caption, and Computers. The LD person, on the
other hand, is often accused of laziness and inattention. Instead of
rehabilitation and accomodations, the LD person is given remedial
drills in what they have already demonstrated they cannot do.  Only
recently has there has been grudging acceptance of the need to
accommodate the LD individual.  On the elementary and secondary
levels, for example, there have been flexibility in the timing of
tests and acceptance of calculators and spell checker. Many of the
accommodations used in Learning Disability, however, have not always
served to improve the education of the LD, but seem more cosmetic.
The aim seems to be to allow the students to "pass" by giving them
lower goals rather than maximizing their potential.

The bias may start in grade school, but it continues throughout life
as this personal experience of Lois Elman illustrates most vividly.


        Zenhausern, Pemberton, Elman  drz@sjuvm.stjohns.edu   30

"In September 1993, I attended a national meeting, in Washington, for
parent advocates of disabled children and their families.  In my
conference packet was an application to be a grant reader for the
Federal Department of Education in Washington, D.C. Since so many of
these programs serviced people with disabilities, an effort was being
made to give that population a voice in deciding which programs
demonstrated merit to receive funding. Being the mother of two
children with disabilities and learning disabled myself, I decided to
give it a shot and apply.  As a school psychologist, I qualified on a
professional as well as a personal level.  Several months after having
filled out all the papers and senta detailed vita of my professional
experience, a representative of the Department phoned and invited me
to come to Washington. "After controlling my initial excitement, I
proceeded to remind the caller that as a learning disabled person I
had to cope with certain limitations.  I asked if I could use my
portable computer to write out any documentation and was told that
they didn't have a program which could be used with a Macintosh
platform.  Since everyone hand wrote their comments on special forms,
I was told that I had to do the same.  When I tried to explain, I was
told that maybe I could be given a Department portable computer but
there were people who were more needy than me attending the session.

"I don't think that anyone at the Department of Education would be
insensitive enough to arrange for a grant reader in a wheel chair to
stay in a hotel room which is not adapted to accommodate the width
of the chair through the bathroom door.  Just because a learning
disability is not obvious on first glance, doesn't the individual
deserve to be treated with dignity and regard for their difference?


The story and plea of Lois Elman illustrates the bias continues
throughout the lifespan.  Often the problem is not as blatant as that
experienced by Lois.  A good example of this can be seen in a series
of e-mail messages from young man in college.   Todd is a student with
LD who fought his way through the special education hoops and hurdles
to an Associate degree and is now enrolled in a 4 year college.

Todd's first message: "School is fine. It is a lot harder then I
thought it would be. I'm writing more papers then I did at my last
college but I am learned alot more about writing papers so it's not to
bad.  I'm only takeing 3 class, but I end up having to put a lot more
time in each of my class then my roommates do just to get the same
grades as they do.  Sometime it gets to me and I don't feel like going
on but I just remind my self of how far I have come and push on.  My
teachers are good this semester.  I go to them alot for help and they
set down with me and help me.  I also go to the learning center ever
day for help on writing.  They have helped me get better grades on my
papers then if I just did then my self.


        Zenhausern, Pemberton, Elman  drz@sjuvm.stjohns.edu   31

A few days later, a second message:

"Hi remmber when I said that I have trouble studing 5 chapters at once
well I have to do it for my Tuesday class.  This is the class that I
know what is going on but when it comes to takeing the test I don't do
as well as I want. I know what the problem is.  I have trouble
remmbering tec words. I can tell you what is going on but sometimes
that does not help on a test because the teacher wants just the word.

Todd has "dysnomia," which is characterized by an individual's
inability to find the correct word or words to express himself.  Ask
a dysnomic child "What is a steeple" and they will say, "The thing on
top of a church".  Ask "What is the thing on the top of a church
called?" and they cannot answer.  This child has difficulty reading
since they cannot articulate the printed word and have what can be
compared to a "tip of the tongue".  We have all probably experienced
the frustration of having a word or name just beyond our ability to
say it.  Such a child might read uncle for the word aunt.
Comprehension without articulation.

Fortunately for Todd, the teacher was a kind and patient man who gave
his time to help prepare Todd for the exam and he ultimately  did
very well.  The teacher was helping Todd by preparing him for the test
in private sessions.  I would hope that all teachers showed the
dedication of that man, but it is important to point out that he was
using a remediation approach and not accommodation.  An accommodation
to Todd's unique disability would have been to ask the questions in a
different way.  Changing the evaluation procedure, rather than drill
in passing a test would have been easier on both student and teacher.
Prepare a test for the student rather than prepare the student for a
test.  The whole experience had a very positive effect, as can be
seen in this message from Todd after a talk he gave on LD for one of
his classes.

"This was the first time that I ever gave a speech on this problem
and it made me feel special.  I liked the idea of telling people of a
problem that not too many know about.  I also felt that after my
speech my class mates treated me a little different. They never
treated me bad before but sometimes when I read out loud or spelled
something they would make fun of it.  Not really me just what I said
or spelled.  But after, one person came up to me and said, "I gess I
can't bother you about your spelling anymore.   I think if it is
possible that people who have these problems should say something and
teach other people about it so everyone can have a understanding of
what a LD person must go threw to learn to make in life.  Since then
Todd has found a pen pal in Virginia who has spina bifida and has
volunteered to be a tutor for LD students who are part of the DO-IT
project at the University of Washington.


        Zenhausern, Pemberton, Elman  drz@sjuvm.stjohns.edu   32

Even if this type of discrimination is eliminated, however, the
original learning disability remains and the next section of the
paper is a summary of how specific accomodations are being used.


                     Solutions in Technology

Low Technology

The use of Adaptive technology in the education of those with
learning disabilities has come a long way since the days of
"perceptual training" when the learning disabled were trained to walk
on balance beams in an effort to improve their reading skills.
Notebooks, three-ring binders, index cards, xerox copies of someone
else's notes, typewriters, color overlays, special colored glasses,
and color-coding, highlighters, vcr's and video tapes, tape recorders,
calculators, spell checkers, and personal computers are some of the
various high and low technology options used by the learning disabled.

Learning disabilities vary greatly from one individual to the next
making it difficult for others to determine what the problem is and
how to solve it.  Such a person must often diagnose and solve his or
her own problems, often battling problems with low self-esteem or a
sense they are "stupid" because others do not seem to have similar
problems.  Embarrassment over having to use various crutches and
adaptations often deter the learning disabled from sharing with
others what "works" for them.

There is a need for less drill and more alternative approaches to
learning, evaluation, and productivity.  In the Altlearn Discussion
Group (Altlearn@sjuvm.stjohns.edu,log9105) there was a debate on the
nature of Learning Disabilities that was punctuated by some heated
discussion.  There was considerable disagreement on many issues, but
all participants agreed on one thing:  an LD student must be taught in
the way he or she can learn and it was up to the educators to find
that way.

An interesting contrast can be seen in the use of technology in
Accommodation for the Blind and Remediation for the Learning Disabled.
Accommodation for the Blind can range Voice Box Synthesizers that
allow the Blind to communicate internationally across the Computer
Networks to a Guide Dog.  High Technology remediation for the LD child
is all too often the substitution of computer drilling for the
traditional workbook drills.  Low Technology Remediation is the
workbook without the computer.


        Zenhausern, Pemberton, Elman  drz@sjuvm.stjohns.edu   33

The following series of approaches aimed at educational disabilities
are based on actual research and classroom practices and illustrate
the scope of accomodations that have been used.  Markman and
Zenhausern (1989) found that about half the children in a mainstream
class and 85% of LD children can not use verbal rehearsal to learn
material.  They found that the classic "Cat, C- A-T, Cat" used for
spelling or the typical verbal repetition of the arithmetic tables
actually interfered with retention for these individuals.  The problem
is compounded by the fact that this verbal repetition approach to rote
learning is in such wide-spread use that individuals continue to use
this counter-productive strategy beyond the K-12 school years. They
question their own intellectual ability rather than the ineffectual
strategies they have been taught to use.  An alternative strategy is
for such individuals to learn rote material by imaging the letters or
numbers.  When it come time to recall the material they can retrieve
that image.  They must make a conscious effort not to repeat the
material either out loud or silently.

In contrast to this group, 15% of the individuals with the Learning
Disabled label and 50% of mainstream children can make very effective
use of a verbal repetition strategy. These are the people who learn
best by putting the ideas into their own words and explaining it to
someone else.  These are people who say they want to ask a question,
but actually repeat what was just said in their own words.  There is
an interesting distinction between the two groups of individuals:  one
learns best by listening, the other learns best by speaking.  This
distinction is not limited to those with LD but is manifested by
everyone to some degree.

Perhaps the most debilitating form of Learning Disability stems from a
problem with reading.  Difficulty with reading is one of the earliest
that appears in school and typically plagues individuals throughout
their lifetimes.  At home and in school, reading all too often means
the ability to translate verbatim the printed word into sound.
Skipping words and substitutions are unacceptable even though they
preserve the meaning of the text.  Individuals maintain that
inadequate definition of "reading" after the K-12 school years, and
thus maintain a self-image of reading disabled.

Kalisky, Zenhausern, and Andrews, 1990 found that most children we
have termed reading disabled do not learn to read because of the
standard strategy used to teach reading.  They identified two types
of reading disabled individuals.  The Phonetic Disabled group has
difficulty with the first step of standard reading methods, converting
a word to its sound.  This can be seen by their poor performance in
matching two words on the basis of rhyme despite the fact that they
can match on the basis of meaning.  These students struggle to
pronounce every word and as a result, often lose continuity in the
text.  They are dysnomic and suffer from chronic "tip of the tongue".


        Zenhausern, Pemberton, Elman  drz@sjuvm.stjohns.edu   34

The second type of child is the Semantic Disabled reader who has no
problem with the matching of two words on the basis of rhyme, but
shows many more deficits in matching two words on the basis of
meaning.  These children will give a perfect word-for-word rendition
of text, but have no comprehension of the meaning of that text.  The
semantic disabled reader can convert words into their phonetic
representation, but there is no conversion of this representation into
its meaning.  Even non-reading disabled individuals have experienced
"reading" text and suddenly realized that they were not comprehending
the words that had been "read".  The Semantic Disabled reader does
this on a chronic level.   These two deficits exhibited by the
Phonetic and Semantic Reading Disabled Children can be directly
related to the standard approaches used when teaching reading.
Children come to school with auditory comprehension, that is, when
the they hear the word "ball" they know it means "a round, bouncy
thing".  Reading means that when children see the letters b-a-l-l they
know it means "a round, bouncy thing".  Virtually every reading method
is based on the strategy of converting the written word to its
phonological counterpart so that meaning is derived from auditory
comprehension.  This approach has been termed the indirect
phonological route to meaning.  The child sees the word, says the
word, and understands the word from its sound.  This can be most
clearly seen in a phonetic approach, but holds equally well for a
sight "look say" approach.

An alternative approach that does not depend on the standard indirect
phonological route to meaning has been termed Direct Access because it
teaches reading by connecting the printed word to its meaning
directly.  Direct Access at simplest level presents words and
corresponding pictures are on separate index cards. As soon as the
student learns to pair the words and pictures the student understands
the word.  The accommodation for these individuals is simple:  allow
the student to summarize what is read, or answer question about the
text, but do not require him or her to read aloud word for word. In
other words, the emphasis should be on comprehension rather than oral
rendition.  The Semantic Disabled reader can "read" aloud fluently,
but has no idea of what they have just read.  We all experience this
from time to time, but these students have the problem on a chronic
level.  They, especially have been called lazy or inattentive and
punished for their handicap.  These people can learn to read using the
Direct Access approach, but there is an instantaneous "cure" through
the use of accommodation.  Let the person read aloud into a tape
recorder and then listen to the recording to understand what was just
read.  This is a strategy that may be especially effective for adults
with semantic reading disability.  Incidentally, individuals who
fall into this group also tend to learn by speaking.


        Zenhausern, Pemberton, Elman  drz@sjuvm.stjohns.edu   35

Tape recorders are also invaluable for recording lectures and meetings
in order to accommodate difficulties with listening, comprehending and
remembering. For learning disabled person who find it easier to
concentrate with background noise, tape recorders or radios with small
headphones can provide the accommodating without disturbing others
nearby. VCR's, videos (including the many self-help and how-to videos
now on the market) are also especially useful to many learning
disabled persons.

In addition to the problems of learning to read, LD adults often
resort to the use a variety of solutions to everyday problems.
Co-author Lois Elmore shares her experiences in buying a small
business:

"The seller knew I was learning disabled because she had received a
detailed vita.  Yet, she wanted to negotiate the price of the business
without having the benefit of any other professionals being involved.
I realized that because I have gaps in my understanding of certain
types of communications, I needed to bring in another person to listen
and reflect back what was said.  I wound up bringing an accountant to
assist me with negotiations."

"Just as a person who is blind benefits from a scanner to input text
into the computer, I need other people to help me get around my
"blind spots".  In my way, I am using assistive technology.  I used to
be ashamed to ask someone else to help me do what I thought I should
be able to do for myself.  This feeling is constantly being reinforced
by others.  I now feel differently. I realize that if its OK for an
individual who is deaf to use a TDD or a person who can't type on a
key board to use a text scanner and switch, then its OK for me to have
other people assist me through those areas of difficulty.

Individuals with learning differences need to have good insight into
their own gaps in order to know when to ask for help, as well as why
kind and amount of help then need.  Some other low-tech options
include clear colored plastics overlays for printed material, index
cards for note-taking, and pocket calendars or any of the "executive"
organizer books and binders sold at many stationary stores.

With the advent of the computer chip many low-tech paper and pencil
aids have gone electronic.  Tiny spell checkers take the place of
clumsy dictionaries, small calculators do mundane math chores, and
electronic address books, calendars, and organizers take the place
of their paper predecessors.  These items can be purchased alone, or
incorporated into a multi-use computer, which can be a station at
home, at work, or a "laptop" or Powerbook handily hung from a
shoulder.  Software that anticipates the word from the first three
letters typed, and spell checkers and grammar checkers on the most
widely used word processors help tailor the computer to the specific
needs of the learning disabled person.  Spreadsheets allow the use to
"figure out" the formulae for every-day functions so that they are
instantly available as needed.  Data bases, project planners,
calendars, and similar software allow users to conquer those
pervasive organizational problems.

The Computer Networks

The computer networks have been considered the "Great Equalizer" for
disabled individuals and this holds true for learning disabled
individuals of all ages.

Electronic mail and mailing lists, real-time chat, and text-based
virtual reality have become the motivating factors and students with
learning disabilities are now motivated to write clearly and with no
errors in spelling and grammar.  It is not uncommon to see these
children cutting lunch to find a little more time on the networks.

The Chatback Group provides an example of the use of mailing list for
education of cognitively impaired children.  Chatback is a project,
based in the United Kingdom and supported by IBM.  It was originally
aimed at language impaired children, but has been expanded to include
education in general with an emphasis on students with disabilities.
The following are examples of what has been accomplished.

Chatback is a project oriented list, designed to provide guidance and
support for teachers who are using the computer networks in their
classrooms.  During the past two years Chatback has introduced
several projects including:

Far Star where children responded to an Alien Being about the policy
and practices of Earth.

The Holiday Dinner, where children from all over the world described
a holiday meal;

Steel, where the 10 steel yachts, involved in a race around the world,
posted latitude and longitude.  Children followed the race by plotting
that information on maps.

Memories tells the story of World War II in Europe through the eyes
people who lived it.   A soldier who survived the Croatian Death
March; a schoolboy who lived through the London Blitz, and a Holocaust
survivor are just some of the people who are telling their stories.

In addition to the Chatback discussion aimed at projects for the
children, there are are other lists with different orientations.

Autism provides a forum for those interested in Autism and other
developmental disorders.  The subscribers include parents, relatives
and friends of individuals with autistic individuals, teachers and
researchers in the area, and individuals who are autistic themselves.


        Zenhausern, Pemberton, Elman  drz@sjuvm.stjohns.edu   37

Bicompal (Big Computer Pals) serves as the "classified ads" for
individuals who are looking for network contacts for people with
special needs.  The initial goal was to develop Big Brother/Sister or
Mentor/Student relationships among those with similar disabilities.
In practice peer relationships have developed in parallel with the
mentor relationships. One example involves a group of blind college
students in Austria who are planning to communicate with school
children in the New York City Board of Education Visually Limited
Program.

There are many other lists available at varied locations on the
Internet including those on ADD, Traumatic Brain Injury, and a list
aimed at Deaf Children.

Resources for education may be widely available on both gopher and
World Wide Web but the location of these resources has been a problem
until the development of lists like EdRes-L, Gopher Jewels, the NY
State Department of Education gopher, and WWWEduc.

The St. John's University Internet node has a special resource called
Unibase. Unibase has been under constant development by Leigh Calnek
of the University of Regina over the past 10 years and there are over
30 systems currently in operation in Canada, New York, the
Philippines, and Thailand. Unibase is a comprehensive system which
encompasses the most important forms of electronic communications
currently available on the for computers and the Internet.  These
include: local and Internet email, discussion groups, access to FTP,
telnet, and gopher, WWW and interactive conferencing.

The Unibase system at rdz@sjuvm.stjohns.edu has been integrated into
the Education and Rehabilitation network that is emerging at St.
John's.  During the past six months Unibase has been used as a
real-time conference center and recent conferences have included:
    1) A panel on learning styles, with panelists from the US and Canada
    2) On ongoing discussion group on violence in the schools
    3) Olga Galkina, from Moscow, was available for several Broadnets
       on Unibase where she was available to discuss her efforts to get
       disabled children in Russia on the Networks.

Note: A Broadnet is almost the opposite of a broadcast. A Broadcast
sends all the information across the nets in all directions.  A
Broadnet attracts those who telnet to participate; it is more like a
fishing net.


        Zenhausern, Pemberton, Elman  drz@sjuvm.stjohns.edu   38

A Multiuser Object Oriented (MOO) environment is a text based virtual
reality world in which the participants create their ideal
surroundings.  They are an offshoot of the text based adventure games
such as Zork except that the players have the power to create their
own rooms and objects.  Jeanne McWhorter saw the educational potential
of such an environment and created Diversity University, a virtual
college campus that was meant to provide the tools for higher
education.  At the present time, it is possible to walk through
Dante's Inferno or take part in a simulated Battle of Agincourt.
Diversity University Prep was created as a K-12 extension of DU and
several projects have been developed for children in special
education.  Learning disabled students from NY and VA are creating a
virtual performance of Shakespeare's The Tempest.  Graduate students
in School Psychology are involved in virtual externships with some of
these students and are looking at their creations as possible
protective instruments.  Learning styles are being measured, no on the
basis of the scores on some instrument, but in terms of the
environments the children actually create on the MOO.

While the emphasis has been on the learning disabled child, the
computer networks are effective tools for a person of any age.  For
several years, husband of co-author Anne Pemberton, Steve, grumbled
about her growing involvement with the networks even though he
realized that much of her time online was necessary to provide good
experiences for her Learning Disabled high school students. Finally,
he gave in and decided it would be easier to join than to fight. A
plumber and building systems technician by trade, his first time
online included a lengthy chat with a building engineer in New York
City. Soon after, he discovered and subscribed to a mailing list about
the Civil War, which tied into his volunteer work at a local park. His
initial trials of the gopher and World Wide Web systems yielded
information useful to, and to be incorporated in the History Pavilion
of the Virginia's PEN, to be used by Virginia students studying that
period in history. Steve's learning disability is most obvious in his
writing, which compares poorly to the rich language skills he has in
speaking, listening and reading. Use of the keyboard has increased the
quantity of words he generates, from single words and short phrases to
paragraphs of 2-3 complex sentences.  As with many new users, he's too
excited by the immediacy of electronic communications to do much
offline writing (which can be "cleaned up" by spell checkers and such),
so uses the "ask the wife" method of getting words down recognizably.

Summary, Conclusions, and Implications

One focus of this paper has been on the discrimination faced by
individuals with cognitive disabilities.  In summary, there is an
underlying bias against all types of cognitive disabilities that does
not exist for those with sensory and physical disabilities.  The
student who cannot see  is not blamed for being blind, but learning
disability is somehow seen as the fault  of the student.  It is
fortunate that the techniques that maximize the potential of a student
we term learning disabled maximize the potential of all students.  We
have to eliminate our teaching disabilities and learn how to teach
more children.  Then we do not have to use the label Learning Disabled
as frequently.

A second point of this paper is based on the historical fact that the
main emphasis of the 20th Century was to perfect and automate the 19th
Century and the main emphasis of Education was to preserve the 19th
Century.  During these past 200 years we have seen a growth from the
quill pen to desk top publishing; from laborious hand calculations to
calculators and spreadsheets; from hand drawing to CAD; from library
card catalogs to World Wide Web.  Throughout this whole period,
however, Education has stressed the importance of handwriting,
arithmetic tables, and dated research techniques.  Why do we give
closed book tests, with an arbitrary time limit, where the student
does not have access to calculators and spell checkers?  This may be
appropriate for the 19th Century workplace, but it does not reflect
the tools essential for the 21st Century.  Our conception of the 3 R's
must be expanded and modified and there must be a re-evaluation of
what we mean by Elementary Education




Reading

Reading disability is one of the most serious problems in Education
today since it is a basic tool of any century.  Much of that problem,
however, has at its basis the rigid and standardized approaches in
reading instruction.  An alternative approach, Direct Access has
been summarized earlier, and this is just one instance of flexibility.
There has been a constant debate as to whether a phonetic or sight
approach is better for reading.  Researchers and theorticians on both
sides supported their arguments with words and data. Unfortunately,
with all this debate over the two ways of teaching reading, no one
looked to see if there might be two different kinds of children.
Reading and writing should not be taught, but expected of a child, the
way listening and speaking are expected and not taught.


        Zenhausern, Pemberton, Elman  drz@sjuvm.stjohns.edu   40

Writing

The complaint that students do not how to write is echoed from the
Halls of the Third Grade and the halls of the University.  Pre School
children want to "write letters" explain things, and tell stories and
then they enter the First Grade.  Consider a 5 or 6 year old being
taught to write.  He or she must complete 2 or 3 pages of filled with
the letter "A" and is criticized for sloppiness.  As punishment
children are forced to write repetitive statements.  The separation of
penmanship and creative expression is evident in many programs where
the children write and worry about spelling later or where the teacher
takes dictation for the story the child tells.  I propose to let a
child learn to write on a computer and let handwriting be taught later
as an ancillary skill (much like we currently teach music an art).
Separate creative writing from graphology.  Keyboarding skills are
much more important in the workplace than handwriting.  This has a
natural potential for integration into strategies to teach reading.

Arithmetic

Poor performance in Mathematics is one of the more serious problems
faced by society today since Mathematics forms the basis of scientific
work which underlies progress.  I think that what we call mathematics
disability can be traced to an early problem in arithmetic.  Children
who cannot master their tables, multiplication, long division, etc.
are held back from advanced mathematics.  Given the widespread use of
calculators in the workplace, an insistence on rote calculations is
not a realistic preparation for the world after school.  I would like
to suggest a program based a three-pronged approach to the teaching of
mathematics: standard "paper and pencil"  calculations, intensive
experience with approximations, and extensiveuse of electronic
calculators and computers.  In the case of uneven development in these
three areas, the child will be allowed to progress differentially so
that difficulty in one prong does not interfere with growth in the
other prongs.

The final point of the paper is that we need to add an "I" for
information to the Three R's.  To survive in the 21st Century, a
person must know how to find information and know where to look for
information.  In the 19th Century, the goal was to cram as much as
possible into your memory.  In the 20th Century, the 19th Century was
automated.  In the 21st Century, one goal is to cram as much data as
possible into computer memory and still be able to find it.  The

"How I lost 20 pounds on ### The New MOO Diet ###" *
----------------------------------------------------------------------

(* NO, this is not a tabloid article. MOOers have wonderful senses of
humor and fun. You'll just have to get used to it. :-)

I ask you to consider the Diversity University MOO -- a virtual
college campus that exists partly in cyberspace and partly in the
minds and collective imagination of those who visit there.  I ask you
to consider it's power to change REAL lives.

Take me for example:

My disabilities are hidden. I have Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) as a
result of a congenital brain tumor and subsequent surgery for its
removal in 1990. I have spent the last five years trying to return
to "normal".

I have begun to realize that what I experience now, may BE "normal"
for the rest of my life.  I have cognitive or sensory overload. Too
much noise, light, or conversation can be overwhelming, tiring and
even painful. This makes working, playing and navigating in real life
difficult.

Working in a traditional office environment is draining as the
fluorescent lights, noise and activity add up quickly -- on many
days a few hours of that is all my poor brain can manage to process
before it just shuts down.

Then there is playing. Until recently there was no energy left over
for playing after coping with the added stresses of just trying to
live with these new challenges that crept into my life as insidiously
as the tumor grew.  I would often refuse invitations to social
gatherings like parties or concerts because I knew they would be
PHYSICALLY taxing.

As for navigating, driving is difficult as my senses are dulled by
scenery and cars whizzing by while split-second decisions should be
made. After surgery, merely walking has become a task since I have
vestibular damage which causes balance problems. Having to be
conscious of keeping myself upright adds a challenge to the act of
simply walking, which most everyone who can, takes for granted.


        Samantha  samajane@mit.edu                            42

However, besides just avoiding overloading situations there are some
things I discovered I can do to ease the strain on my body. For
example:  I often wear my sunglasses or a baseball cap indoors to
reduce glare from fluorescent lighting.  I have been known to sit
down in public places when I get dizzy (including taking advantage
of the wide edge of the refrigerator cases in the grocery store. No
kidding. :-)   I have even borrowed a wheelchair a few times at the
shopping mall which helped a lot; it more than doubled the time I
could spend there.

One of the most frustrating and difficult aspects of having Acquired
Brain Injury is that I appear perfectly healthy. I *LOOK* "fine". I
know that some people therefore think I am odd or even exaggerating
because I wear sunglasses indoors or use a wheel chair. (I wonder what
goes through the mind of the shopping mall attendant when I mosey up
to the counter, ask for a wheel chair, sit myself down and wheel off.)
These preventative measures may seem odd, but I have noticed that
using these strategies extends the time that I can DO things!

Many people just can not comprehend brain injury because it is
invisible.  Someone even suggested I was agoraphobic. A phobia is an
inexplicable and illogical fear of something. My "fears" of being in
large groups of noisy people, or malls full of noise and bright lights
and chaos that cause my senses to overload (therefore decreasing my
ability to function) are not inexplicable or illogical as a
neuropsychologist or a fellow ABI survivor can confirm. Withdrawing
in this way from social situations to prevent debilitating overload
is not understood by people who think you *LOOK* just fine.

Being "anti-social" does not fit my personality either. Being dictated
by my body to limit my exposure to people and sensory stimuli, in
order to pamper my damaged brain has been very frustrating and lonely
if not devastating at times.

I did not recognize that person, MYSELF, sitting on the couch day
after day, numb from interacting with people, dizzy from standing too
long, tired from just looking and listening....

I used to be a person who thrived on interacting with people, running
around half-crazed trying to get as much done as humanly possible
every day. Again I say:

I did not recognize *THAT PERSON* sitting on the couch day after day,
numb from interacting with people, dizzy from standing too long,
tired just from the simple effort of looking and listening. That just
wasn't ME. It was my body there, but it wasn't ME.


        Samantha  samajane@mit.edu                            43

I will never forget my first "trip" to Div. U., one Friday night in
March 1994. I was supposed to go out... to a party... that night, but
I was too tired to deal with people. So I stayed home, turned on the
computer and started surfing. I reached this place called Diversity
University and went to a party there instead. I was overjoyed!  I went
to a party and I didn't even have to leave the house. Best of all
there were no side conversations, no radio in the background, in fact
no noise at all, no sensory overload. I could sit quietly, socializing
with people in an environment I could manage.

Diversity University gave me my personality back. I can exercise the
REAL me who is unfortunately trapped by a brain that doesn't work like
it used to.  It gave me back real life capabilities. I can run around
the campus meeting every one, talking and socializing, like the maniac
that I am, but in silence. It is the social environment I desperately
needed that is not physically debilitating or painful. (Hmmmmmmm, now
if I could just get a JOB there.... :-)

There are so many aspects of DU that are beneficial for me. I could
write another article on that, but here are some examples.  I have
trouble attending to real life conversations.  At DU I don't have to
ask people to repeat themselves because I didn't hear what they said,
it is captured in text on the screen. I can read it over 5 times if I
need to. It is not as embarrassing as having to ask people to repeat
themselves in real life. Also, I don't have to walk for miles across
campus to attend classes or meet friends and professors. And when I
am tired I can just turn off the computer. I don't have to worry about
the commute home, because I am already there.

"What about ### The New MOO Diet ### ?", you ask.

Yes, I have lost 20 pounds since I discovered the DU MOO just a few
months ago, and would directly correlate this pleasantly surprising
change to my participation there. Diversity University lightened my
MOOd (no pun originally intended) and lifted my spirits; it gave me
something fun I could do, and there is no food allowed in the computer
room :-).  But mainly it helped me to acknowledge and accept and
overcome some of my limitations, at least "virtually."

Using the MOO technology I saw my productivity increase. I saw the
differences between trying to manage in real life and managing better
with computer assistance. This realization gave me the confidence to
try other "assistive" technology. I finally broke down and got a
walking stick. (Don't call it a cane or I will bop you with it.)
Now I can walk longer distances and therefore I get more exercise.
THAT is how I lost 20 pounds on "The New MOO Diet."  :-)

If you call *RIGHT NOW* you can order  ### The New MOO Diet ###
Companion Cookbook.  Call 1-800-NEW-MOO-DIET... But WAIT!!!!...
there's MORE! ~

My disabilities are very subtle, and you would never guess anything
was wrong if you met me; it is a blessing and a curse. I have had to
struggle to define my limitations and accept them. While they are
still VERY hard to accept in real life, Diversity University offers me
an opportunity to forget them for awhile and to accomplish more and
operate more efficiently while I am there. Sometimes I wish I could
live and work full-time in cyberspace.

Cyberspace empowers the disABLED. Those who cannot, CAN in cyberspace.
Someone with cognitive overload can maintain an active social life
because they can control their environment. A person who must always
rely on a wheelchair in real life can run and jump and play at the
MOO, just like everyone else. A person whose hearing is impaired can
now "listen" to a group conversation in room full of talkative people.
Can you imagine the impact these newfound freedoms have on people's
perception of themselves and ultimately upon their lives???

Cyberspace is a leveler. Technology is a powerful tool which is
creating a new social structure where equality among individuals is
more asymptotically approached than is possible in "real life"
circumstances.

My experience at Diversity University has enlightened me. I envision
endless possibilities for enhancing people's quality of life. It has
certainly improved mine.  I hope these simple words conveying my
experiences may enlighten many more and inspire wider use of this
incredible resource.

MOO and other cyber applications must be acknowledged, advertised and
fostered. The myth that this environment is just for game players must
be destroyed.

I challenge anyone who reads this to share it with at least one
healthcare, medical or rehabilitation professional, to spread the
word so that "cyberspace" may become an integral part of REAL LIFE for
those who can benefit most from this new environment that has emerged
using creative technology.

The possibilities are VAST and definitely transcend cyberspace.

The future is now.

Just MOO it.

        Donut - StarkNet Campus of the Future

CANTON, OH- Donut was developed in August 1994 by four Stark County,
Ohio middle and high school students as an experiment in cooperation
with StarkNet, a division of the Stark County School District.
Described as the "StarkNet Campus of the Future," Donut is an
on-line interactive learning community focusing on students from
Kindergarten through 12th grade.

Shawn Arbogast (character name Turbo), from Osnaburg High School,
Dave Robinson (Compuwiz) and Andrew Ertley (Q) from Lake High School
and Justin Dobbs(Silence) from Lake Middle School are responsible
for the concept and development of the Donut community.  Their
combined programming expertise made their dream of a virtual on-line
educational facility a reality.  System Operator, Bob Lukens (IDIC),
and Internet Information Specialist Judy Birmingham (JudyB) are the
adult technical advisors who assist the four talented students.  All
of the aforementioned make up the core of Engineers (the Donut
equivlent of wizards).  Arch Engineer, Suzi John (TecSec), computer
technology secretary for the Massillon City Schools in Massillon,
Ohio, manages, promotes and helps with furthering development of
Donut.

Students enter this virtual world initially as guests.  Eventually
they are assigned character names and account passwords to link to
the community.  The Bus Stop is the point of entry for all new
players.  From there they can wander the promenades and streets to
various classrooms, a guidance office and many business
establishments.  Points of interest include the clothing store "You
Wear it, We Sell It,"  The Donut Hole pastry shoppe, Donut Books,
and the International Market complete with such food booths as La
Vela Roja, Der Weinerschnitzel, Viva, The Taj Mahal and The Wok and
exotic bills of fare.  Donut also has a medical center with attending
physician Dr. Kolache, The Daily Planet newspaper office, and the
CompuBank.  A sleep disorder center is being developed by a group of
Marlington High School Students.

While wandering throughout the community you might run into some of
the regular Donut-ites.  Dave_E is from Virginia and has developed
the clothing store and a beautiful central park.  Bluestreak,
Mr.Data, Cally,  Blade, Elvis, Byrnes, Stephen, Philos, Silence,
Jeremy, Gatsby, Quest and others will be wandering throughout Donut
at any given time.  For entertainment you might even find them in the
Rec Room or Blade's Roll-A-Rena, a complete roller blade and skate
boarding arena managed by the colorful virtual bot, Rollin' Joe.

The beautiful Cruller Tower dorms are south of the Bus Stop and
presently are being occupied by nearly 50 residents.  Plans are in
the works to construct Croissant Tower, a twin.



        Suzi John  S_john@sparc3.sparcc.ohio.gov              47

The Puget Sound Community School, lead by Distinguished_Prof, conducts
classes online.  Orca, Bird_Boy, Sorcia, Gorath, Maji, Dipsquat,
Pulp, Autumn_Rain, Red_Petal, Grunge and Smurf reside on the third
and fourth floors of Cruller Tower.

By going south of the Bus Stop and going Under the street you can
embark on an adventure that will take you who knows where.  There are
many rooms and corridors leading to various points of interest on
Donut.

The future of the Donut community looks bright as more and more
students and staff members discover the benefits of on-line
interactive learning.  Donut, created by students for students, is
accessible at bigbird.stark.k12.oh.us 7777.  Development is being
done now on classrooms  and, teachers are being recruited to bring
their classes online.  Additional information can be obtained or
comments can be addressed to S_John@sparc3.sparcc.ohio.gov.

Subject:      Building Tools for Education

                     Building Tools for Education
                      -Ken (aka Ken Schweller)

  Over the past few years I have enjoyed building a variety of MOO
tools which are presently being used here and about for instructional
and educational purposes. These tools include the following Generics:
  - video camera, tape, vcr, tv
  - slide projector, lecture
  - conversational robot
  - classroom, and theater

  The cameras, tapes, vcrs and tv were built on mediaMOO as part of
a Television Station. I had originally intended to broadcast live
shows from the TV Studio but it turned out that folks were more
interested in creating their own documentaries and sharing them with
their friends, so I created a Tape Library. Tapes deposited in the
library could be viewed on a demand basis by any and all players.
Since that time tapes and tvs are being widely used for tutorials,
interviews, film making, and class  presentations.

  The slide projector was built to effect the swift presentation of
bulky text and graphic material to large groups. This tool has seen
wide use in seminars and colloquia.

  The Generic Lecture was built to help students present multiline
material without the necessity of typing at break neck speed.  The
text is entered ahead of time line by line and given in any chosen
order and speed. I found that students who were generally nervous
giving class presentations were much more relaxed when they didn't
have to type in their speech in real time.

  The Generic Classroom and Theater were designed to address unique
MOO communication problems.  Consider the problem of 'too much noise
in one room'.  The approach I used in the Generic Classroom was to
divide the room itself up into subareas in the form of tables, sofas,
chairs, rugs etc.  Folks in a subarea formed their own local
conversation group without disturbing others yet they could still
'hear' the teacher or anyone standing up. I took the opposite approach
in designing the Theater.  This time I interconnected 6 separate rooms
allowing folks to see and hear folks in other rooms under varying
degrees of communication control.  The theater was intended to be much
more than just a place to watch movies or see plays.  It was designed
as a presentation forum where the level of speaker/audience
interaction could be subtly controlled on a sliding scale of absolute
quiet to full 6 room interaction

  The Conversational Robot was originally designed as a toy. Since
then it has seen serious educational use as a 'drill and kill'
vocabulary tester, tutor, room guide, and information assistant. This
is the tool kids have the most fun working with.


        Ken Schweller  schweller@bvc.edu                      50

  I have thought a lot about what constitutes a really good MOO
educational tool  Here's the list of tool characteristics I've come up
with. A good tool for MOO education must be:

   *Useful*      - must serve a REAL pressing need. A clever tool
                   that serves no important need is best recycled.

   *Easy*        - must be VERY easy to use. A tool should have a
                   familiar look and heft. The verbs should be
                   easily guessable without using @exam and the
                   consequences should be predictable.

   *Fun*         - must be a bit whimsical. If folks don't enjoy
                   using the tool, they won't. But not cute.

   *Powerful*    - must be powerful enough for kids and professional
                   researchers/educators. A tool must 'grow' with
                   you as your moo experience increases.

   *Adaptable*   - must be capable of use in many different unforseen
                   ways.  No one can predict what uses a clever person
                   will find for a good tool.

   *Evocative*   - must be a catalyst to evoke new ideas in users.
                   Simply using a tool should suggest to the user
                   new possibilities.

  I am still actively engaged in Tool making and welcome any
suggestions from my colleagues on the design of the latest greatest
tool. :)

                Diversity University Grant Center

Got a great idea for an innovative project but need funding and
partners?  The Grant Center at DU may be the place to begin your
search.  Set up as a central repository of information on funding
agencies, grant listings and general grant writing information, the
Center also  fosters collaboration between DU users from many
different geographic areas and disciplines.

A gopher slate titled Grant Opportunities lists many of the government
Internet sites offering grant information.  These include such
agencies as the National Science Foundation and the National Institute
of Health.  Current funding opportunities are listed along with
guidelines and submission criteria.

A catalog of DU users is also available at the Grant Center and is
keyword searchable.  Those individuals who have completed their @info
with relevant information regarding their occupations and interests
can be linked with others in the same interest area by searching for
a particular keyword, such as history, English, music or K-12.  Once
individual names are found the searcher can then contact the
individual for collaboration on a project.

The Grant Center is also the location for funding projects involving
the incorporated, non-profit agency known as Diversity University.
Support services and hardware require donations of time and equipment
not always adequate to meet current user needs.  The Grant Center is
the focus of the planning for and the solicitation of such current and
future development funds.

Can project and grant collaboration on DU MOO work?  Ask the three
professors preparing to begin implementation of an Annenberg/CPB
project that was developed at DU or the individuals involved with a
recently submitted Department of Education grant.  Collaboration on DU
can be very rewarding.

1) Education MOOs
   --------------
This column is the first of a series of articles covering Education
MOOs. As new moos are popping up steadily, we can only discuss a few
typical examples now. We will try to cover as many Education MOOS as
possible in future issues.



2) Education Tools
   ---------------
One of our aims is to compile a comprehensive list of Educational Tools.
Most of the Education MOOs have a 'gopher slate' but how many have a
World Wide Web client like the 'WWW slate' developed at EON.

A core set of Education Tools includes:
* writing tools: '$note', 'MOO mail'
* standard communications features: 'say', 'page', 'emote' and 'think'
* exploration tools: 'look', 'read', and 'exam'
* manipulation tools: 'get', 'grab', 'drop', 'move'

Added to these, are 'generic' tools created by individual programmers,
especially wizards. Every Education MOO needs dedicated wizards!



3) Education MOO list

                The Soul of a MOO Machine

Abstract: In considering the attraction and future of Diversity
University and other educational Virtual Realities, the author
considers three aspects of the "Soul Factor" in people's connections
to such environments. The author also maintains that this "Soul
Factor" must be sustained for these environments to continue
developing their fullest potential.

Introduction:

  Whenever I try to explain to people what Diversity University is
and what I spend so much time doing there I find myself struggling
with realities.

    Well, my home computer uses the phone line and calls another
    computer where I have an account. This more powerful computer
    gives me access to the Internet. That computer connects
    through fiber optic cables to another computer in Daytona Beach,
    Florida. That computer has in it the MOO program and a database
    called "Diversity University." One database record has my name
    on it. When I connect I occupy that piece of the database. Other
    parts of that database are described as rooms or as objects to
    look at and use. Still other records are other people. And if
    you are connected at the same time as other people your pieces
    of the database can interact and it appears that you are talking.

  It is usually at this point that I notice a glazed look forming in
people's eyes, and I wonder why people don't understand. Yet while
this description sounds a little outlandish it does reflect one view
of the virtual reality environment we call DU Moo.

However, this techno-view of reality can easily become a trap. It is
sometimes tempting to think only of the wonders (or the
frustrations) of the computer terminal we are using, or the awesome
knowledge that our touch triggers electric signals that travel at
the speed of light from Iowa or Alaska, or Texas, or Israel, or
Germany, or Australia or wherever we come from to gather someplace
in Florida only to be sent out to all those places again. Or some
programming conundrum can so capture our attentions and imaginations
that we see DU as some crazy place to program fun things; being
virtual gods in total control over the very nature of that reality.
Or, if we have experienced text adventure games or some of the more
combative Muds and Moos on the Internet, we can view educational or
social environments as wonderfully inviting for mischief and
competition.

  The techno-view is a trap, because when we are seduced by it, we
fail to see what DU and other educational environments have that
make them so different. Then even we who share a larger vision of
those environments can end up messing up the future of such
environments. For that not to happen we need to recognize and
intentionally maintain what I call the "Soul Factor."



        David Morris  bweaver@worf.infonet.net                62

      "The Soul Factor"

  There are many parts to our lives. There is our intellectual
part -- the place for ideas and understanding. There is the emotional
part -- the locale for our reactions to events and our judgments about
ourselves and the world in which we live. There is the physical
part -- the place where we sense our reality and where we actively
respond to it. Finally, there is the soul. I see the soul as that
aspect of our living that gives meaning and significance to all the
other parts. One could think of the soul as the unifying web of our
lives: everything we do affects our soul and in return is influenced
by what we deem important and worthy.

  We need to remember the "Soul Factor" in considering the present and
future of virtual realities such as DU, because it was the soul of
the place that encouraged our initial participation, and it is the
soul of the place that either keeps us coming back or leads us away.
Just as a human being needs an active soul to live a life of meaning
and fullness, so does a place (even a virtual place) need a soul to
continue to be vital to its participants.

  As I reflect upon my involvement in and continued commitment to
Diversity University and as I consider the prospects of future
expansion of its mission, I can identify three aspects of DU's soul
that must not be forgotten or neglected in order for DU's future and
the future of other similar educational realities to be long and
fruitful.


        Soul Factor #1: Connected for Support

  Since I identified myself as an ordained minister of a church and
set myself up as unofficial Chaplain at DU, I have been amazed at
how often people come to myself or to others for emotional and
spiritual support in trying to handle the circumstances of their
lives. There are many nights when I have found myself bleary-eyed at
2 or 3 in the morning talking to someone who desperately needed to
share their struggles with another human being who will listen. And
I know that I am not the only one in that activity. I have even been
in long-distance page conversations with people who need some advice
on how to handle the stories they are hearing. There is an active
'alanon' support group with 3 loyal participants. And I have been
told that at least 2 people on the verge of suicide have been
"talked down" through the Moo environment.

  And it isn't only the negative parts of life that are shared here. I
know of romances that have developed through the wires as well as
friendships. I count as real friends a number of people whom I have
never met physically, but with whom I have been connected through
the words we type. Why is that? And more importantly, why SHOULD
that be true?



        David Morris  bweaver@worf.infonet.net                63

This is an important first factor in considering the soul of a Moo,
because it reminds us that on the other end of all those cables and
electrical signals sits another human being with hopes and hurts,
and with visions and disappointments. There sits another person who
is searching for something more in their life. Maybe they log on out
of loneliness or because they seek for knowledge. Or possibly when
they connect they are stumbling toward compassion and relationships
yet want to remain hidden behind the secure filter of the words and
the signals. Whatever the issues are (and I know I have heard only a
fraction of them) they come along with the character that logs on.

  The danger of the filter is that people might interact as an
altogether different character. On some Muds and Moos that sort of
role playing is encouraged, but in an educational environment this
sort of deception can be detrimental.

  Learning and growing involves a certain level of risk and of trust.
The risk in learning comes as we lower the defences around what we
already know and open the way for some new ideas to be entertained.
Most of these ideas represent re-adjustments to what we already know.
But some ideas represent radical changes to one's world view -- the
fundamental way we approach life, the universe and everything.
When you are open to learn you do not know what type of ideas will
come your way. In order for people to continue taking that risk in
learning there must be maintained an environment of trust, honest
interaction and genuine concern.

  This is true in real life where one can see and touch and listen to
the other person. Yet, when we come into a virtual reality situation
where the only contact one has is through a set of words that appear
on a computer screen, this environment of trust is more difficult to
maintain. However, when the participants remember the need and
intentionally foster and encourage supportive interactions, the
learning environment will reinforce trust and allow people the
opportunity to continue learning.


        Soul Factor #2: Connected for Curiosity

When I was growing up, (before the gas crunch), my families Sunday
afternoon entertainment was to go out driving. To explore the
community, looking at the houses and yards, seeing what things are
out there to see. My Dad had a particular way he would approach
these drives: he would never repeat a path. We would drive along the
road and my Dad would comment on how he'd never seen THIS road
before and then he would turn onto it. I think the game he was
playing was the let's-get-lost-and-see-if-we-can-find-home-again
game. We always did make it home and we always saw some interesting
things along the way. I continue part of that tradition while
driving on my real life journeys as well as when I journey through
virtual reality.



        David Morris  bweaver@worf.infonet.net                64

  Every few days (or sometimes every couple weeks) I set my programs
aside and leave my construction unfinished and just 'walk' around
the Moo. On those 'walks,' I always try to go to parts that I have
not seen in a while. And when I do, I will sometimes see what old
friends have been doing lately, but am more likely to meet new
friends and experience new learning experiences. Why is it important
for me to do that? A drive for curiosity.

  What makes an education institution (even a Virtual Reality one)
continue is a genuine interest among its participants in the process
of learning. Whether as a teacher or a wanderer, it is the prospect
that through the next exit there might be an object, a room or a
person that holds something new to learn or to think about. In
talking with Jeanne McWhorter, one of the founders of Diversity
University, she used the image of a "living encyclopedia" in
referring to DU. I thought that image was both appropriate and
intriguing in considering the future of educational realities.
Through the diversity of people that participate and through the
wide range of interests they represent it is not too far-fetched of
an idea to see a virtual reality environment develop into just such
a resource. And as more people have access to such educational
environments it is ever more important for them to broaden those
resources so that people's curiosity will continue to be captured
and many more people will go out and "walk the moo."


  Another aspect of text-based virtual realities that makes education
there so interesting and accessible is that with creatively
programmed objects and some description skills the journey of
learning can be one of true discovery. Why just read about bones
when you can walk through Yorick the human skeleton. Or imagine how
you can discover pre-history by joining cave-people in fishing or
hunting, or even rediscovering the spiritual joys of delighting in
the world and in one's self by becoming a child in a playground of
delight. One's imagination is the only limitation in how different
ideas and facts can be taught and demonstrated.

  And when the learning is fun, people will continue to explore. And
as people continue to explore they will be inspired to share some of
what they know and the cycle continues.

        Soul Factor #3: Connected for Partnership

  One of the objects that takes up a surprisingly large amount of my
time is the "Generic Notice Board" on DU and Collegetown. It started
out as my attempt to make a place where I could store interesting
quotes without having to bother the wizards for quota for $note
objects. It also provided a worthy first programming project. Well,
I worked on the initial version for a couple weeks and set it up and
convinced a couple friends to use it as part of its testing. It was
simple and I was pleased with how it turned out.

  Then a couple people paged me one day. "I'm using your Notice Board
and think it's really great, but have you thought about making it do
this..." They both then shared with me their vision for how they
could use the object much more efficiently if it did something more
or different. Well, I guess I am a sucker for good ideas and they
convinced me of their vision. So, I took out my code and looked at
it with some new eyes and adapted the code to add the new options
that were suggested. Not too long after that and then again and then
again other people paged me or wrote me with their appreciation and
then their suggestions for making it more useful in fitting into
their vision for their participation in DU. Some of the suggestions
have been easy, I can call up the verb in my editing window and work
on it while we are talking and they can try it out right away.
Others have been more far-reaching in the scope of the changes and
take a couple days or even (as is the case in the last major change)
a couple weeks. But the time and energy have not been an issue for
me, because I have caught some piece of someone else's vision for
using not just my object, but for using the environment.



  This is one example of the type of partnership that is possible in a
Moo environment. While some types of large group discussions are
often confusing and difficult, the ability to have people from
various locations interact in real time makes possible other types
of cooperative endeavors. This exploration of ways of cooperation
are important to the soul of the Moo. A shared vision for what we
can do together in this place. As long as there is an attitude of
co-creating the virtual world (with the freedom and responsibility
that goes with co-creation) then the soul will be strong. But when
either of those two polarities overpowers the other, the soul is in
danger.

  When freedom is abused and seen as freedom to do anything to anyone
because the virtual world is not really real then people will choose
to leave rather than face the offensive behavior. On the other hand
if too much emphasis is placed on control, then anyone with an urge
or desire to make something useful and interesting will not find
support or encouragement and will go elsewhere with their gifts, or
might even stop desiring to create and contribute from their unique
experience and set of interests.


        Conclusion

These three pieces of the soul of the Moo need to be honored because
they form an environment for growth and development. And even if we
must continue to deal with people who come and trample on our
flowers or insult the neighbors or even punch us in our virtual
faces, when we remember our connections as human beings, our
connections as learners and our connections as creators, the
environments will continue to thrive and face the challenges and
celebrations that come from our participation.

                COLLABORATORY

The University of Hawai'i at Manoa Rainbow Advantage Program has
initiated a project called Collaboratory, a project that links
together museums, universities, and secondary schools around the
country.   Students are engaged in meaningful and integrated learning
and through exploration, discovery, and manipulation, students work
with exhibits to further their critical thinking skills, broaden their
base of knowledge, and enhance their understanding of culture.  This
project encourages intellectual curiosity by allowing students to
choose from a wide range of topics as well as modes of expression.
Museums offer places for learning which are not confined to the
traditional school setting or time frame.

Collaboratory will also move into making museums available to people
not able to access their exhibits through the front door.  Technology
has made it possible to recreate museum exhibits in many forms, making
it possible for students across the world to interact with exhibits,
explore them from many vantage points, and study them on numerous
levels.  Thus, Collaboratory is a two strand project -- one has
students studying exhibits all over the country, the other has
students creating their own exhibits (their own interpretation of
culture).  This project reaches a wide audience and is in line with
the Goals 2000 mandate.

TEAMS

A team consists of university and high school students, as well as a
museum or similar cultural institution.  The formation of the teams is
determined by the unique contribution each part makes to the whole.
The high school students perform much of the work of the team, while
the university students provide both an academic direction and study
of the project.

The use of museums is the interesting addition to the project. It is
an emerging theme amongst museums that they provide a learning
environment that is quite different from the classroom.  They not only
cover an unlimited range of subjects, they do so at the visitor's
pace.  They provide teams with 'triggers for wonder'.  The major
permanent exhibits -- a museum's icons -- act as both projects for the
teams as well as models for works of their own generation.

Museums provide yet another opportunity for students; they permit
students to become the experts on these icons.  Since no museum can
provide the Internet presence necessary to field all possible
questions, the students can become the 'experts' for some of the
first-level and most commonly asked questions.

The results of the composition of these teams is a group of students
who mutually benefit from working together and are given access to
resources from a cultural institution with which they are familiar.
Ultimately, all are working toward a project which is meaningful.



Margit Watts and Ben Millard  watts@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu    68

PROJECTS

The results of these collaborative efforts will be exhibits; in this
context, the term exhibit is loosely defined.  Students will find
expression for their work in multi-media, text, performance, music,
and any other medium they find relevant to their project.

An example of some of the work by current teams includes video
documentary on the effects of hurricane Iniki on Kauai, an exhibit on
ancient net fishing in Hawai'i, a modern day re-creation of Plato's
Republic, and a display of a corner of Pittsburgh.  Each of these
projects have called on the students to search for something important
and determine how they want to present it.  It is through these
projects that the students can work to make sense of their place in,
and contribute to their culture.

INTERNET

The Internet plays a role in this as the medium for participation.
It will provide the link between the members of a team, as well as
across the teams.  The other value added by the Internet will be a
place to 'store' or present the exhibits.  It is our intention to
open a MOO for the teams to use text-based VR as one medium for their
works.  Providing them with a place to met on-line as a haven will be
one of the most important steps in our development.

Amidst the discussion of the latest telecommunications,
Collaboratory's model does not *require* connectivity beyond paper
and mail.  It is this sclar approach to the student's resources that
will allow Collaboratory to form teams in countries not part of the
Internet.

POSSIBILITIES

Collaboratory exists under the auspices of the University of Hawaii
and is directed by Dr. Margit Misangyi Watts.  The current structure
consists of six teams among the islands of Hawai'i, as well as teams
from California, Pennsylvania, and Western Canada.  In January new
teams will be added from Illinois, Washington D.C., Missouri, Japan,
Guam and Kenya.

As we prepare our server for duty, we are also building the corporate
support necessary to fuel Collaboratory.  We have some corporate
connections in place and will also be seeking grants and equipment
from other sources in order to support the teams with equipment.



Margit Watts and Ben Millard  watts@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu    69

The future holds the expanded bandwidth modes mentioned above, as
well as simply growing the reach of the teams in both geography and
involvement.  Plans for involving museums is not limited to local
ones, though we feel that it is within their own communities that the
teams can make their biggest contributions.  Creation of national
icons could become a project that joins multiple teams in
illustrating a country's cultural context.

As we seen to put our students at the center of their own education,
Collaboratory tries to extend this to include putting the students in
the center of their own cultures.  We welcome your comments and
participation.  Please contact us by the means below.

         The Beginning of an Education MOO

The following excerpts are from an interview with Jeanne conducted
by Lunar at DU. The full tapes are viewable at DU, please contact
Lunar or Donald at Diversity University or email idd@io.org.
Imagine the text scrolling up your screen, pausing every few seconds.

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "first was a fellow called
Sandoz, Billy Chambless, the fellow who brought up the blank MOO."

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "he invited me to write on
his tabla rasa"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "I had first just thought
about doing a psychology/social work building"

[on projection screen]      Lunar asks, "then what happened?"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "I loved the idea of all
the things we could use the MOO to teach."

[on projection screen]      Lunar asks, "So you decided to expand the idea?"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "but when he offered me an
entire MOO, I decided it was too limv:iting to make it just one
subject, so I figured why nookt create an entire university"

[on projection screen]      Lunar asks, "who else did you enlist?"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "first was a young man
from erau who kinda found us somehow, by using "who" on his unix
account to see who was where"

[on projection screen]      Lunar asks, "So you started DU in Miss?"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "thant was Mogue"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "yes, it was on a private
account then, in Miss. and was called Chaos Theory"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne did not like that name

[on projection screen]      Lunar asks, "So what did Mogue do?"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "and there was another
MOO named Chaos so I convinced they we had to change the name"



        Flora Moon  Lunar at DU                               71

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "Mogue was a MOO programmer type"

[on projection screen]      Lunar asks, "what was his take on MOO's or
did he follow your lead?"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "for some bizarre reason they
all liked my vision"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "Ulf came next. I recruited him"

[on projection screen]      Lunar asks, "Why Ulf? and how did you know him?"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "I used to hang out on MediaMOO and
 lambda still while working on DU cause it was still pretty lonesome here"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, I ran into this twit with the name
 spitboy

[on projection screen]      Lunar laughs

[on projection screen]      Jeanne . o O ( Ulf will love that sentance )

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "except when he explained the
story behind the name, I found myself very touched"

[on projection screen]      Lunar asks, "and?"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "he too liked the concept and
came to help"

[on projection screen]      Lunar asks, "are there others? who
contributed to getting DU started?"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "at some point we realized
that we all needed to be wizards here to really do anything, so he
made us wizards"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "sandoz was the only wizard
up to that point. I can't remember the order of wizing, but I know I
was first, then Mogue"

[on projection screen]      Lunar asks, "How long did it take to open DU?"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "oh, quite a while. I went
massively recruiting for teachers, mostly on lambda and Media"

[on projection screen]      Lunar asks, "a year, two years?"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "we are only just over a
year old right now"

[on projection screen]      Lunar exclaims, Oh that's significant.
The level of organization and sophistication blows me away here!



        Flora Moon  Lunar at DU                               72

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "I handpicked most all the first ppl"

[on projection screen]      Lunar asks, "Before we move on, any others
you want to mention?"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne thinks.  Richelieu, naturally, but
he was not until January.  Leslie was one of our first teachres on DU,
as was NikkiC, who is not really active here anymore.  Cindy came the
same time leslie did

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "SteveDF was among the first
as well, and Andrew"

[on projection screen]      Lunar says, "I'm glad you mentioned some
women, I was beginning to wonder..."

[on projection screen]      Lunar asks, "So when is the first anniversary?"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "it was last fall"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "they did the very first
research on DU, with their two english classes, Leslie Harris and
Cindy Wambeam. Les was a primary author of the proposal for the
Annenberg grant we just received"

[on projection screen]      Lunar asks, "Can you tell me a little
about the research?"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "They both taught freshman
english composition and universities across teh country from each ohter"

[on projection screen]      Lunar asks, "how did DU come in?"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "the wanted to see if they
could stimulate greater interest and enjoyment of writing in their
students by using the MOO"

[on projection screen]      Lunar asks, "can you explain how they used the MOO?"

[on projection screen]      Jeanne says, "so they used a control
group and then brought classes on to discuss the books they read and
to write things on DU. The did a formal research project, using
double bliind pretests and postests"

        Ken at CollegeTown

Excerpts from interview of Ken at Collegetown by Lunar assisted by idd.
Imagine the text scrolling up your screen, pausing every few seconds.


[on TV]      . . .the camera zooms in on Ken. . .

[on TV]      You see a middle-aged professor type who likes to fool
around with computers and virtual worlds. He is one of the janitors
here and is happy to help or chat.

[on TV]      Lunar says, "First of all I want to say happy
anniversary, Collegetown is one year old!"

[on TV]      Ken says, "thankyou <beaming>"

[on TV]      Lunar says, "How does it feel to be the father of all this?"

[on TV]      Ken says, "I do indeed feel like a father at times, and
like all fathers i hold in my heart a great love and tenderness for
this moo which I have seen develop from a single room and a half dozen
members to its present size and scope.."

[on TV]      Lunar says, "What is its present size and scope?  "

[on TV]      Ken says, "sorry for the delay, i was running some stats
programs on our community.."

[on TV]      Ken says, "the stats show we are presently at 306 members,
of which 115 are from Buena Vista College.. either students or faculty.."

[on TV]      Lunar says, "And who are the others?"

[on TV]      Ken says, "The others include undergraduates, graduate
students, faculty members, assorted folks from various communities
and several children.."

[on TV]      Lunar says, "Why did you build collegetown?"

[on TV]      Ken says, "I have decided it is important to include
members of all ages.."

[on TV]      Ken says, "I built Collegetown as a platform for
collaborative academic research and teaching.. with the intent
that academicians of all ilk might meet here to exchange ideas,
work together on projects , and hold seminars.. I also thought that.."

[on TV]      Ken says, "having the theme be *only* academic was unduly
restrictive.. so I have divided collegetown into 3 theme areas.."

[on TV]      Lunar says, "Could you elaborate?"



        Flora Moon  Lunar at DU                               74

[on TV]      Ken says, "There is foremost the campus itself, then
there is the 'city', and finally the outer wilderness and nature
area lying all about.. here is where.."

[on TV]      Ken says, "folks can build houses for themselves and do a
bit of socializing.. It is my belief.."

[on TV]      Ken says, "that much valuable research and thinking takes
place 'outside' the classroom while folks talk and socialize so i believe.."

[on TV]      Ken says, "it is important to provide open spaces like
seashores, forest walks, mountains etc.. as stimulants to good
conversation and the exchange of ideas.."

[on TV]      Ken says, "After all, Socrates himself did his thinking
on his feet strolling through the marketplace.. <grin>"

[on TV]      Lunar grins

[on TV]      Lunar says, "I was wondering if you would take us to a
favorite place and we can return here if it is too crowded"

[on TV]      Ken says, "i have many favorite places <grin> lets go!"

[on TV]      Ken  heads for the South Quad...

[on TV]      You are on a grassy quadrangle surrounded by ivy covered
buildings.

[on TV]      Lunar says, "What happens here?"

[on TV]      Ken says, "this is just a quad.. a central hub connecting
many academic buildings.. mostly people just socialize here on the lawn.."

[on TV]      Lunar says, "I notice a lot of humor here, tell me about that"

[on TV]      Ken says, "humor? such as?"

[on TV]      Lunar says, "Robbo, for instance a wise cracking humble
servant.."

[on TV]      Ken laffs.. 'Every creation reflects in part the
personlity of its creators.. Collegetown is no different...

[on TV]      Ken says, "I find moos immensely enjoyable .."

[on TV]      Lunar agrees

[on TV]      idd says, "robbo may have been around earlier if I recall?"

[on TV]      Ken says, "and I am pleased that my joy overflows into
some of my objects.. appearing there as 'humor'  <grin>"



        Flora Moon  Lunar at DU                               75

[on TV]      Lunar says, "Who's idea was it to make the ascii
representations of spaces like the quad here?"

[on TV]      Ken says, "as i mentioned before, we have many middle
school students working here and they contribute there own form of
humor.. <laff>"

[on TV]      Ken says, "ah, I believe this is one of the firs moos
to be fully ascii mapped.. its not just the quad.. *everything* is
mapped (or will be)... "

[on TV]      Ken says, "I have chosen to do this because.."

[on TV]      Ken says, "I believe that spatial orientation is a
strong component of thinking..."

[on TV]      Ken says, "we can use our innate proprioceptive skills
to help orient ourselves in virtual space just as in physical space.."

[on TV]      Ken says, "we are *used* to operating in physical space,
we feel at home there.. my goal is to bring as many senses to play in
VR as is possible.."

[on TV]      Lunar says, "I feel *oriented* here because of the ascii
mapping, an instant familiarity that the maps confer..."

[on TV]      Ken smiles

[on TV]      Ken says, "i am very interested in the interfacing of WWW
and moos to show graphics and sound... I am following with keen
interests the work of gustavo, pavel, and others in this area.."

[on TV]      Ken says, "I feel that present moosters are much like the
early pioneers heading West in coverd wagons.."

[on TV]      Lunar nods vigrously in agreement

[on TV]      Ken says, "Where we now go by foot over untracked deserts,
future mooers will travel by jet plane.."

[on TV]      Ken smiles

[on TV]      idd says, "are there many classes held here at CT?"

[on TV]      JeremyS  arrives from The Forum...

[on TV]      JeremyS says, "ahem, could I ask you a question Dr. Schweller?"

[on TV]      Ken [to idd]: DU holds many more classes than we do.. we
hold small seminars and there are writing workshops and a few faculty
meet with grad students here.. and a few regular classes have been
held.. we look forward to doing much more in the future..

You see a student with glasses and dark hair

[on TV]      Ken grins jeremyS, smile, you are on camera, i am being
interviewd by these folks..

[on TV]      JeremyS smiles, uh sorry...

[on TV]      Ken says, "Jeremy is a new member of Collegetown,
and a member of my 3 week cyberspace class.."

[on TV]      JeremyS says, "Would you like me to leave?"

[on TV]      Ken says, "you may ask him a question if you like <grin>"

[on TV]      Ken grins jeremyS, of course not!

[on TV]      Lunar says, "I'd like him to ask his question, if he
swouldn't mind"

[on TV]      JeremyS says, "Well, I was wondering if there was a way
to erase keywords from our robots?"

[on TV]      Ken [to JeremyS]: sure, just '@exam botname' and you
will see how to use 'remove' to erase a keyword..

[on TV]      JeremyS says, "alright, thanks"

[on TV]      Ken says, "for example,  'remove 5 from robot'"

[on TV]      JeremyS says, "ok, bye.."

[on TV]      Ken says, "use the number of the word."

[on TV]      Ken waves

[on TV]      Lunar waves

[on TV]      JeremyS waves back

[on TV]      Ken says, "ok.. lets check out the downtown area.."

[on TV]      Ken  heads for Main Street!

[on TV]      Ken says, "This is the hub of the second theme.. we saw
the 'Gown'.. this is the 'Town'"

[on TV]      Lunar says, "And the statue of Pavel Curtis?"

[on TV]      Ken says, "we have yet to see 'Country'  <grin>"

[on TV]      Ken says, "in honor of the founding father of all Moos..
<bows head in reverence..>"

[on TV]      Ken says, "Collegetown is run by a council of 7 citizens.
They meet every week or so in City Hall to decide matters of
application, quota, and building.."

[on TV]      Lunar says, "Do you sometimes bowl while you're meeting?"

[on TV]      Ken laffs, the bowling alley was a project by one of my
computer science students who wrote th longest single verb ive ever
seen.. 8 pages!

[on TV]      Ken says, "i had to give him a refresher course in
modularity  <grin>"

[on TV]      Lunar says, "One verb for strikes, spares and scratch?"

[on TV]      Ken nods, laffs.. and ascii pictures..!

[on TV]      Lunar says, "and scoring and shoes? "

[on TV]      idd says, "did it work though the 8 pages?"

[on TV]      Ken says, "yup, but then the moo crashed and he lost it
all! he was heartbroken and i felt terrible.."

[on TV]      Lunar says, "Life in cyberspace..."

[on TV]      Ken says, "An important thing I've tried to accomplish
here, btw, is to create a "

[on TV]      Ken says, "feeling of community.... Each of our members
is encouraged to build.."

[on TV]      Ken says, "1) a house  and 2) an office.... and the
houses are to be fully connected so"

[on TV]      Ken says, "that we have residential communities and
neighborhoods.."

[on TV]      Ken says, "we can put in a hard days work at the office or at
school and then retire to our communities neighborhoolds for relaxation.."

[on TV]      Lunar says, "talk to me about the culture here at CT.
There is a distinct one here isn't there?"

[on TV]      Ken says, "Yes, I like to believe there is.. We are
insistent on theme related building and we advertise ourselves as a
serious academic community.."

[on TV]      Ken says, "it is largely a matter of self selection..
we purposedly chose to remain small and rather obscure.. I have"

[on TV]      Ken says, "been very reticent to publish our address..
Most of us know each other and we ahave a strong cadre of 'founding
fathers and mothers'.. to instill our vision in the new folks.."

[on TV]      Lunar says, "And what are the values engendered and
exhibited here?"

[on TV]      Ken says, "this is by no means the only or best way to
run a moo.. I fully appreciate the naturally evolving social format.."

[on TV]      Ken laffs, I would *like* to think that the shared values
here are love of things scholarly, an appreciation for creative work,
and a shared vision of utopian community buildintg.. but then again,
maybe all thats just in my imagination ;)

[on TV]      Ken says, "we have some strict rules here such as:
No weapons, No harassment.. etc.."

[on TV]      Ken says, "hi johnM, im being filmed for an interview.."

of helping going on, a real comaraderie and desire to build somthing
together"

[on TV]      Ken says, "I do not wear blinders however, I realize that
our good spirits here may be a simple accident"

Hi Everyone

There have been a number of people subscribe AFTER the first edition of
DU Journal of Virtual Educations was issued to the list.

I thought I would give this group a command which will allow them to
retrieve the Journal.  Here are the instructions.

Send a mail message to listserv@sjuvm.stjohns.edu

LEAVE THE SUBJECT LINE BLANK.  In the body of the mail message put this
command on the first line and nothing else in the message.  No sigs etc.

get jvre-all log9501

You will have the journal in your mailbox in a short while.  Please be
advised that this is a very large mail message.  The articles were sent
one at a time at release, but this command will give you the ENTIRE
journal in one file.

Look for an announcement to the list about the journal being placed for
gopher access and perhaps FTP as well.

If anyone has problems getting the journal with the above command, please
write me and I will send the journal to you.

Good Luck!

Dick
